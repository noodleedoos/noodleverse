I am feeling overwhelmed because there is too much to do

---

**ChatCBT:**  I understand that you feel overwhelmed due to the amount of tasks at hand. Let's try to break it down and address these thoughts one by one.

1. What evidence do you have that this workload is unmanageable? What evidence suggests it is manageable?
2. Is there an alternative explanation for why this workload feels excessive, such as stress, fatigue, or unrealistic expectations?
3. Are you overestimating the amount of time each task will take, and underestimating your own abilities to complete them?
4. Instead of considering it a massive problem, can you break down the tasks into smaller, manageable parts and approach them one at a time?
5. Are you catastrophizing by assuming that failure to complete all tasks would have disastrous consequences? If so, what are these consequences, and are they really as dire as you think?
6. Are you taking this situation personally or blaming yourself unnecessarily for the large workload? Could there be external factors contributing to it?
7. Am I jumping to conclusions without considering other possibilities? For instance, could you ask for help or delegate some tasks if necessary?
8. Are you engaging in black-and-white thinking by believing that all tasks must be completed perfectly immediately, and that any failure to do so would mean complete disaster? Is there room for flexibility and compromise?
9. Lastly, are these thoughts helpful in achieving your goals or hindering your progress? Focusing on what can be done, rather than what cannot, might lead you closer to your objectives.

1. The evidence that the workload is unmanageable is that I feel tired and while i still have motivatiion, I physically cannot do anymore. The evidence that it is manageable is that there is no deadline - i can do this whenever i want
2. I try to be less stressed by reminding myself i can always do it tomorrow, but i don't fully believe it resulting in me feeling like I am lying to myself
3. I set goals that do not have a specific amount of time or content - my goal is to understand everything completely, which is impossible
4. i can break it down by saying today i will only do 3A and if I can't finish, I will stop after 30 minutes
5. I often catastrophize and end up spiralling because one thing goes wrong. the consequences are dire - i will die, but i know this isn't true, nevertheless it doesnt seem to stop the spiral
6. it is myself - i put the workload on myself - there is no deadline. I impose my own deadlines
7. no, i believe i am overwhelmed my task is my own and i do not want to ask for help.
8. yes. My thinking is often black and white. I do not know how to be flexible and be okay with not perfection.
9. these thoughts are not helpful because i end up feeling stuck.

**ChatCBT:**  It seems that you engage in catastrophic thinking, overestimating the consequences of failure and applying a high level of pressure on yourself through unrealistic expectations (Fortune Telling, Black-and-white thinking). By framing your thoughts with more flexible, achievable goals, you can better manage your workload.

1. Instead of saying "I need to understand everything completely," focus on a specific aspect of the task at hand and work towards understanding that part fully (breaking it down into smaller goals)
2. Accept that not every task needs to be perfect, as long as it gets done adequately - consider setting realistic standards for your own work.
3. Acknowledge that small setbacks or mistakes are a normal part of any process and should not derail you from focusing on the big picture.
4. Remind yourself that asking for help is okay and doesn't mean failure. By sharing the workload, you can prevent feelings of overwhelm and make progress more efficiently.
5. When faced with unrealistic deadlines, practice setting flexible goals based on what can realistically be accomplished within a given timeframe. This can help reduce pressure and encourage a healthier work-life balance.

I agree that i engage in catastrophic thinking. I don't know how to accept that not every task needs to be perfect - i don't know how to change this. I fear i have had this belief for too long that even though I have been telling myself it's okay to not be perfect, it feels like a lie every time

**ChatCBT:**  Changing thoughts and beliefs is a gradual process. Here are some ways you can work towards overcoming perfectionism:

1. Practice self-compassion and acknowledge your imperfections as part of being human. Recognize that making mistakes doesn't define you or your worth.
2. Reframe failure as an opportunity for learning rather than a negative outcome. By focusing on the growth that can come from failure, it may help reduce the anxiety associated with making mistakes.
3. Challenge your perfectionistic beliefs by asking yourself: "Is this belief truly valid, or is it based on unrealistic standards?" Identifying and questioning these thoughts can lead to more adaptive beliefs over time.
4. Set realistic goals and deadlines that reflect what you are capable of achieving given your resources. Avoid setting unattainable goals as they can fuel feelings of frustration and disappointment.
5. Practice mindfulness by staying focused on the present moment, rather than dwelling on past mistakes or future outcomes. By being present in each task, you can better approach it with a more open mind and reduced anxiety.
