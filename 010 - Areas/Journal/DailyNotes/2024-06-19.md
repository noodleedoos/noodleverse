## Chat

I am sad and I don't know why


---

**ChatCBT:**  I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but it's great that you've reached out for help. Let's start by identifying some situations or conditions in your life that might be causing anguish:
1. Work or School
2. Relationships (Friends, Family, Romantic)
3. Finances or other practical matters
4. Health concerns
5. Personal goals or aspirations

Next, let's take a look at your thoughts, emotions, and beliefs about these problems. Can you please share some examples of negative thoughts that come to mind?

[All-or-Nothing Thinking, Overgeneralization, Mental Filter, Disqualifying the Positive, Jumping to Conclusions, Mind Reading, Fortune Telling, Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization, Emotional Reasoning, Should Statements, Labeling and Mislabeling, Personalization]

For example, if you often think "I always mess up" or "Everything I do is wrong," these are examples of negative thinking patterns. Can you relate? If so, let's work together to reframe your thoughts through cognitive restructuring.

Here's an example question: What evidence do I have to support this thought? What evidence contradicts it?

By addressing these patterns and reframing your thoughts, we can start working towards a more balanced perspective. Let's continue discussing the examples you shared, and together we'll find solutions for each situation.

I am sad because I woke up at 12pm and i didn't get out of bed until 2:30. I went for a walk to go find cats but I could find any cats. I played some piano and now it is dark outside. I feel like I wasted the day again.

---

**ChatCBT:**  All-or-Nothing Thinking:
I woke up late and didn't see any cats, so the entire day was a waste.

Catastrophizing (Magnification):
The fact that I didn't see cats means the entire day is a disaster and wasted.

Let's reframe these thoughts using evidence to support a more balanced perspective:
1. What evidence do I have that my day was a waste because I woke up late or didn't find cats? Is there any evidence that contradicts this thought? (Yes, there are multiple examples of positive moments throughout the day, such as going for a walk and playing piano.)
2. Was today really a complete disaster just because I missed finding cats or slept in later than intended? What other productive activities did I accomplish during the day? (You played the piano.)
3. What is the alternative explanation for this situation? Could there be external factors that impacted my ability to find cats, like their activity levels at different times of the day or the weather affecting their movement patterns? (Yes, these are possibilities that may have influenced the situation.)
4. Is there a way to learn from this experience and improve in the future, such as planning better or seeking new locations for finding cats? (Absolutely, it's always good to learn from our experiences!)

By considering these questions, we can start redefining our thoughts in a more balanced manner. It's essential to recognize that our actions are not defined by a single event or circumstance. Focusing on the positive aspects of the day will help create a more hopeful and optimistic outlook moving forward!

1. I have evidence the day is a waste because it is dark outside and all I did was go for a walk and play piano. There is evidence against the day being a waste because I went outside and played piano, and the day isn't over yer
2. It isn't a complete disaster of a day because I went outside by myself for the first time in a long time, and managed to practice piano. I was planning on spending the whole day in bed and I didn't do that.
3. I can't just wish for cats to appear and have them appear. I wish I could though.
4. In the future, I could go to a cat cafe if I want to see a cat or research about cats if i cant find any outside

**ChatCBT:**  Great job! Let's keep focusing on finding constructive ways to approach your goals:
1. What evidence do I have that this was an unproductive day because I went for a walk and played piano? (There isn't evidence to support this thought, as there are several examples of productive activities that you completed.)
2. Is it fair to label today as a waste just because I didn't achieve something related to cats? What other positive aspects of the day did I experience? (Yes, it is not accurate to label the entire day as wasted. The walk, piano practice, and self-care by going outside are all positive moments that should be recognized.)
3. Is there anything I can learn from this experience about planning ahead or finding alternative ways to accomplish my goals when faced with unexpected challenges? (Yes, researching cat cafes or learning more about cats' behavior and movement patterns will help plan for future encounters.)
4. How will reframing these thoughts in a more balanced manner benefit me in the long run? What are the potential consequences of maintaining this negative thought pattern? (By adopting a constructive attitude and finding solutions to problems, you will feel more hopeful and empowered to take control of your life. Maintaining negative thought patterns can lead to feelings of despair and discouragement, which can be counterproductive in achieving long-term goals.)
5. Now that we have identified some potential actions to improve the situation and maintain a more balanced perspective, how can I take steps towards implementing these ideas? (Research cat cafes or learn about cats' behavior to find new ways of interacting with them, and continue focusing on productive activities like self-care and piano practice.)

Remember that changing long-held thought patterns takes time, so be patient and persistent in your efforts. With continued focus and practice, you will develop a more optimistic outlook towards life! Good luck!

1. My evidence that it was an unproductive day was refuted by the fact I went outside, played piano, and the day isn't over yet
2. It is not fair to label the day as a waste. I was happy playing piano today and I am proud of myself for getting out of bed and even brushing my teeth
3. In the future if I am feeling sad because I couldn't find any cats, i could be productive like that.
4. Reframing these thoughts in a balanced manner helps me spot flaws in my logic and where my emotions have overriden facts and evident. Reframing thoughts will help me feel more proud of myself for doing what I cant
5. Today I can start by doing some schoolwork and drinking water.
