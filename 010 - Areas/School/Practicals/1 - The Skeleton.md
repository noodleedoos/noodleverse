## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Demonstrate competence in following anatomical descriptions, required in veterinary practice to comprehend and carry out described veterinary procedures.
- Identify the main bones of the axial and appendicular skeleton of the commonly encountered domestic species (including birds), information needed to understand the skeleton scaffold within the body, on radiography, and as landmarks for clinical procedures.
- Apply skills in observation and deduction to identify and name the bones of the skeleton from different species, as many non-domestic species may be encountered in veterinary practice.
- Apply appropriate descriptive names for major bone features such as crests, tuberosities, processes, fossae, and foramina, required to translate the meaning of veterinary texts to the animal in front of you.
