# Intended Learning Outcomes
- Demonstrate competence in following anatomical descriptions, required in veterinary practice to comprehend and carry out described veterinary procedures.
- Identify the normal appearance of bony features of the upper neck associated with swallowing and prehension including the skull, atlas, axis, and hyoid apparatus, as these structures will be frequently referred to in veterinary practice (e.g. radiography, dental procedures, surgery).
- Apply skills in observation and deduction to identify and name the bones of the head and neck from different species, as many species may be encountered in veterinary practice.
- Apply appropriate descriptive names for major bone features such as crests, tuberosities, processes, fossae, and foramina, required to translate veterinary texts to the animal in front of you.
