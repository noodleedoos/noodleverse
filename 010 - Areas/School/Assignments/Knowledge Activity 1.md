Purpose: to guide a client to becoming a fully functional human - encourage client to be independent, develop coping mechanisms for difficult situations and learn strategies for dealing with issues.
Rightful Expectations: to provide a non-judgemental place to talk about their situation, to be treated equally regardless of personal details such as race, culture or sexuality, to have any collected personal information be stored in a private manner and only divulged in specific circumstances such as by court order, or if the client threatens the safety of themselves or anyone else.

1.	Identify five requirements for planning the counselling sessions.

1. Analyse self assessment forms
- Forms may be completed by an individual prior to the first counselling session that indicate their wellbeing, mental congruency and personal perspective of their situation. 
2. Consult health professionals
- gather relevant medical history such as information about previous struggles with mental health, physical disabilities, or predisposing conditions that affect the welfare of the individual
3. Collect personal information from third parties if client cannot speak for themselves
- In the situation a client is unable to provide information about themselves, consult the disability services from which they were referred to gather any personal information and form a support network.
4. Ensure the logistics of the session are communicated to the client
- inform the client of the location, duration and and agreements prior to the initial session by email, phone or other communication method
5. Analyse the personal information collected holistically
- consider the personal information in regards to the health of a person's physicality, spirituality, mentality, economic status and environment. 

List 5 communication techniques that should be used in counselling
1. Body Language
- Lean forward, make eye contact and maintain an open posture - do not cross arms and legs. This will help make the client feel like you are listening to them and encourage them to talk
2. Attending skills
- Do not interject or interrupt when the client is speaking, affirm their speech by nodding along. Make sure you are concentrating on what the person is saying and not thinking about what you are going to say next
3. reframing
- If a client presents a problem, provide an alternative perspective to the issue by encouraging them to consider alternative thinking styles and patterns of thought.
4. paraphrasing
- After listening to a client, verify your understanding by paraphrasing their speech and summarising your understanding to give them a chance to correct you or add information.
1. Tone
- Mimic the tone of the client in order to make them feel seen and like you understand their situation. If the client is speaking about a difficult circumstance, adjust your tone and ensure empathetic language is used to reassure a client.
