**For the following three example client circumstances, provide a goal for each that may be of use to clients:**

- **A client who is suffering with depression**
- **A client who has experienced domestic abuse**
- **A client who is unable to find a job.**

We can try and set SMART goals for each client, where the goal is specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timely.

- **A client who is suffering with depression**
Given the client may be feeling unmotivated and have trouble getting out of bed, a suitable SMART goal may be something like

Every day for the next week, I can try to brush my teeth at night.

- **A client who has experienced domestic abuse**
If the client is still in an abusive relationship, you should refer this client. If they are not, you can set a SMART goal that focuses on mindfulness techniques and recovery.

For five minutes 5 times a week, take a moment to sit down and practice square breathing, letting any thoughts come and go as they are.

- **A client who is unable to find a job.**
It would be helpful if we knew more about the client's situation and why they are unable to get a job. if the client is unaware of this themselves, you could set a goal

This week on Wednesday, I will go to a jobfinders service and dicuss my options. I will report back to my counsellor at the next session what I have found out.

6 step method
AKA DECIDE model
Define expectations
Establish criteria
Choose good options
Identify pros and cons
Decide on a suitable option
Evaluate outcome

7 step method
Same as 6 step method, but with SMART goal setting where SMART = specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timely.

SWOT analysis

External factors: opportunities and threats

**Provide five ways you can help a client to overcome obstacles to decision-making.**

3. Allow the client to ask questions
4. clarify and concerns and misunderstanding
5. Help the client identify their strengths that could be used in the situation

Action plans can be developed using the

For problem solving you could implement pattern interrupt strategies
1. Play the devils advocate
2. Change something about the problem behaviour i.e. 5:1 rule - 5 good experiences to 1 bad experience

**Why may you need to make a client referral, and provide two examples of this?**
you may need to make a client referral when
- the client's needs fall outside your scope of practice
- the client is threatening to harm themselves or someone else
- the client has engaged in illegal activity
- the client would benefit from a different therapist

Examples

1. Amy is a teenage girl, and I am an old man. Amy feels uncomfortable confiding in me, the counsellor since she feels like I wouldn't understand her worries and concerns. I have tried multiple strategies to help Amy feel comfortable to open up, but it doens't seem to be working and we have not made any progress. In this case, I should refer Amy to a colleague that she may identify with more closely with such as a younger female counsellor or a peer worker.

2. Martin has disclosed to me that he has been living on the streets for the past week and has no money left. He is asking for advice on how to deal with this situation and feed his 13 children. In this case, I would refer Martin to emergency relief services and emergency housing, notify Child Protective Services and any other relevant authorities to ensure the client's wellbeing.
