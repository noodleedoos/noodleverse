I currently have a role as an online tutor for children with neurodivergence or social disabilities. 
1. Children in the Workplace
Since I am working directly with minors, I should be very aware of any ethical or legal considerations involved in this work such as professional etiquette, appropriate attire and conversation for example. Breaches of these responsibilities will result in inappropriate learning environment.

2. Privacy, Confidentiality and Disclosure
I should be careful to maintain the intellectual property rights of the company, Tutero. They provide online resources and I should be careful to only use the resources provided or the resources provided by the student. Breaches of privacy and confidentiality laws will result in legal implications regarding the Privacy Act 1968.

3. Tutor/Client Boundaries
It is important to establish that my role is as a tutor, not a friend or counsellor. It is important to maintain professional language, and do not engage in gossip, inappropriate topics or issues outside my competency. Breach of these boundaries will result in unethical conduct and potential termination of my role.

4. Work Health and Safety
Maintaining Work health and safety in an online requirement may look like allowing students who are struggling to focus for the entire duration of the lesson a chance to get up and have water or a quick snack before continuing. It could also look like ensuring students do not attend lessons if they are feeling unwell, or I am, even if it is online, since the quality of service may be affected. Breaches of these could result in inadequate service delivery.

5. Discrimination
In the code of conduct it is explicitly stated that you should respect individual differences between the clients. You should acknowledge any cultural differences and treat everyone equally. Breaches of this policy will result in emotional distress in the client, and your position as a tutor may be jeopardised.


**For three aspects of your organisation’s ethical policies, identify any instances where there is an overlap with legal requirements.**

In my organisations ethical policies, there are 3 instances where there are overlaps with Legal requirements. These include

1. Protecting the intellectual property of Tutero platform and the client
Ethical policy: protecting student IP and Organisational IP
This is in accordance with the The Privacy Act 1988. I should be careful to protect student personal information as well as the resources provided by the Tutero platform

2. Duty of care
Ethical Policy: tutors must ensure the safety and well-being of students during tutoring sessions
Legal requirement: Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 (Vic) 

3. Work Health and Safety
Ethical Policy: maintain a safe online environment for both the student and themselves.
Legal overlap: The Work Health and Safety Act 2011

**Within your role, identify three legal issues that can arise and explain how you would respond to these.**
There are many legal issues that can arise as an online tutor

1. Privacy and Confidentiality Breaches
Issue: sharing student's IP without obtaining consent breaches Privacy Act 1988
Response: Obtain explicit written consent or verbal consent from the carer before disclosing any information

2. Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse
Issue: Suspected child abuse or neglect requires reporting in accordance with Children, Youth and Families Act 2005
Response: Notify appropriate child protection agencies, maintain confidentiality and obtain any evidence required. 

3. Workplace health and safety Violations
Issue: Failing to create a safe tutoring environment breaches the Work Health and Safety Act 2011
Response: ensure the tutoring environment is free from any potential hazards such as electrical faults, biological contaminants or tripping hazards.

**Within your role, identify three ethical issues that can arise and explain how you would respond to these.**
1. Boundary issues with students
Issue: overstepping professional boundaries - i.e. becoming involved in student' personal life
Response: Establish professional boundaries from the start. If boundary blurring noticed, reaffirm professional nature of relationship

2. Favoritism and bias
Issue: showing favoritism towards certain students on the guise of personal characteristics
Response: Treat all students with fairness and equality. Reflect on your own actions and adjust your behaviour as needed

3. Pressure to disguise negative grades
Issue: Student proposes the possibility to not tell the parents of their academic stance if it is not favourable
Response: Inform student of your duty of care, ethical standards and accurate feedback while considering the emotions and consequences of doing so

**In no more than 250 words, outline your organisation’s process for the review of policies and procedures and the methods available for team members to input feedback and ideas.**

In the organisation I currently work for, Tutero, there are organisational processes for the review of policies an procedures and the methods available for team to input feedback and Ideas

Methods available for team to input feedback and ideas
The main method available for the team to input feedback and ideas is the Circle community. In this community, there are specific channels for providing feedback and ideas to improve the organisation. Additionally, you could directly contact tutor support or the manager on duty.

Policies and procedures are input in the tutor training onboarding, and you must score 80% or higher on a conducted assessment after reviewing the policies and procedures in the training. If you fail to achieve a high enough score, you will not be allowed to tutor with the organisation.

To review these policies and procedures, tutors are required every month to have a meeting with your elected manager. In this meeting, the manager will detail any areas of improvement required in your role, where you have performed well and obtain any verbal feedback directly from you. This is an opportunity for you to voice any questions and concerns in policies and procedures.

The organisation is well structured to allow reveiw of policies and procedures and methods available for team members to input feedback and ideas. Any incidents are required to be logged, and all services conducted must be rerflected on immediately after the session ends.
