He developed the social learning theory which combines behaviourism and constructivism.<br><br>2.     What does identifying and analysing the impact of modelling influences involve?<br><br>Identifying and Analyzing the impact of modelling influences can involve:<br><br>Identifying the modelling influences<br><br>-        Social factors i.e. family, work friends, admirations<br><br>Establishing what kind of behaviour they exhibit<br><br>-        Describe their influences’ common traits and how they would react to certain stimulus<br><br>Identifying times in client’s life when they have exhibited the same behaviour<br><br>-        Consider influences they may be imitating from the past<br><br>-        Any particular influences<br><br>Questioning whether the client can behave differently<br><br>-        Ask them to consider how they might react in a different circumstance<br><br>Considering the benefits of alternative behaviour<br><br>-        How it might result in successful resolution|
