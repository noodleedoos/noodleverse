- **active listening.**
- **non-judgmental language.**

#  **Hints for the CHCCCS014 Performance Assessment**

_You must undertake the brief intervention process with at least two clients. The clients must be presenting with different issues at different stages of the behaviour change process._ 

_The stages of the change process are:_

- _Pre-contemplation is when someone is unaware of the problem_
- _Contemplation is when someone is aware of the problem and the preferred behaviour_
- _Action is when someone practices the desired behaviour_
- _Maintenance is when someone works to sustain the changes._

_To be successful in their intervention you will form a relationship with your client, the best way you can do this is to employ active listening skills._

_Active listening requires you to feed-back what you hear to the speaker. You should do this by restating or paraphrasing what you heard in their own words._

_Feedback shows understanding and involves both verbal and non-verbal communication. This method allows the client to have adequate time and space to make reasoned decisions. It enables you to actively listen to their concerns and address them._

_As active listening is a very considerate approach you will be aware that you are to use non-judgemental language, this will help you build a rapport with the client effectively._

_Throughout the interventions, you will need to take a supportive approach with your clients, by doing so you will create an environment and a relationship in which your client will be able to make progress._

_To assist with the client’s decision making you must facilitate the self-determination of their client. This can be done by agreeing upon goals._
