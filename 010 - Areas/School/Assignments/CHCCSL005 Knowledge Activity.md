**List three types of learning theories.**
Behaviourism
Knowledge acquired when behavioural response to environmental stimuli
Passive absorption via repetition and positive reinforcement
Extrinsic positive and negative reinforcement
Via absorption of correct behavioural responses

Connectivism
Process of connecting nodes and sources
Intrinsic goal setting
Collaborative learning via own research and different modes of learning

Cognitivism
Constructed in social contexts via community interactions
Collaborative integration of new info via students into knowledge community
Intrinsic goals and extrinsic rewards from knowledge community
Learning guided by others and group work

Constructivism
Constructed based on preexisting cognitive structures
Active integration of new information to existing structures
intrinsic via personal goals
External parties responsible for providing learning environment

**How does the view of motivation differ between the Behaviourist, Cognitive Constructivist and Social Constructivist learning theories?**

Behaviourism
Extrinsic positive and negative reinforcement via absorption of correct behavioural responses

Cognitivism 
Intrinsic motivation and extrinsic rewards from knowledge community

Social constructivism
Intrinsic goals with external reward, intrinsic with personal goal

**List three stimulus and response techniques for use in counselling.**

Systemic Desensitisation
Asking a client to rank fear experienced in different anxiety provoking stimuli between 5-100
Train client deep muscle relaxation techniques and work through anxiety hierachy

Flooding
immediately exposing client to prolonged real situation that is anxiety inducing after teaching deep muscle relaxation techniques.

Modelling
Observational motivation - witnessing someone else confront your fears who has the same phobia and watching them overcome it.

**Explain how different elements of environments can impact on behaviour.**
- Home environment
	- Consider aggressive family members
	- dirty living space
- Learning and work environment
	- impact of peers and pressure
- Social Status
	- Wealthier social status enjoy more personal and professional success
	- Income, occupation, level of education and opportunity
- Media influences
	- Cultural role models
	- Celebrities

**List three types of reinforcement.**
Direct Reinforcement
The individual performs an action to which there are consequences inflicted upon themself

Vicarious Reinforcement
Observational learning via witnessing a relatable other performing an action to which there are consequences, then applying this knowledge to their own actions and anticipating the consequence.

Self Reinforcement
Intrinsic motivation without external motivation to increase desired behaviour with intrinsic goals


**Explain the difference between classical and operant conditioning**

Classical Conditioning
Refers to stimuli and response
i.e. the physiological response of your mouth watering at the sound of a bell after being trained that the bell means food
An involuntary response

Operant conditioning
Refers to consequences of behaviour, and the cause of an action
i.e. training a dog to sit by offering them a treat.
A voluntary response


**What did BF Skinner propose?**

BF Skinner was a psychologist in the late 20th century that proposed the concept of positive reinforcement in operant conditioning. He proposed that positive reinforcements helps strengthen desired behaviours.

**List three types of reinforcement.**
Positive reinforcement
Increasing the frequency of desirable behaviour by adding a reward
e.g. training a dog to sit with treats

Negative reinforcement
Increasing the frequency of desired behaviour by removing a consequence
e.g. getting rid of homework because students are well behaved

Self reinforcement
Increasing th e frequency of desired based on an intrinsic motivation and personal reward.
e.g. studying to get good grades because it makes you feel good
