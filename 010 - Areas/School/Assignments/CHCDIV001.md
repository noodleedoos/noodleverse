# **Task 1:**

**For this task, you will be required to reflect on your own perspectives on diversity.**

Spend some time considering your own upbringing, where you grew up, where you now live, your family and the friends you keep and how this has had an impact on how you see diversity.

Produce an extended response covering the points below, considering how your own life thus far has brought you to your current perspectives on diversity.

  
Ensure that you:

  
1. Identify and reflect on your own social perspectives and biases  
2. Identify limitations in self and social awareness  
3. Identify positive areas of your self-reflection and how this will benefit your ability to work inclusively  
4. Identify ways to improve own self and social awareness.

  
**Your extended response should be approximately 800 to 1000 words**

## INTRODUCTION
I have grown up in a very privileged manner - my father is a doctor, my mother is a dietician. This means that I have always had enough money growing up to have more than enough to eat, and enjoyed the luxuries of the upper class. Throughout my life I have never had to be worried about money, and even as an adult I know that even though I don't live with them anymore, I can still rely on them if I really need. 

Throughout my childhood, there have been no major familial conflicts. My family gets along well and I currently live with my sister and see my parents every so often. I I was shown love and care all throughout my life and was never subject to any significant or identifiable forms of abuse or trauma.

My spiritual background is widely accepted in the country I live, and so far there have been very little problems regarding my gender, sexuality, political preferences, age, appearance and other culturally defining factors that could ostracise me. 

I believe I fit into cultural diversities and have stereotypical social perspectives and biases which I should be conscious of. The way I was brought up has had a significant impact on the way i perceive diversity.

## MY SOCIAL PERSPECTIVES AND BIASES
 I come from a South-East Asian background from Singapore and Malaysia, but grew up in Australia as a minority in the early 2010's. I am neurodiverse and have mental health issues i.e. ADHD, ASD, MDD and GAD. I may be biased in favour of befriending those who I can relate to - I am inclined to show more compassion for those who have gone through similar life experiences as me. I am able to better socialise with people who have a similar thinking pattern to me and can find it difficult to interact with people with close-minded opinions.  I believe that I hold some unconscious biases that could be problematic, though they have not yet been uncovered as of yet. I am biased in favour of people identify with and against those who intentionally ostracise others for their differences.

## MY LIMITATIONS IN SELF AND SOCIAL AWARENESS
Since I am on the Autism spectrum, I have impaired social awareness and have many communication difficulties. I consider this a major limitation as I am often able to correctly infer the emotions and intentions of those around me. This may translate to inappropriate analysis of my true self and social awareness which I should be wary of when considering social circumstances. I like to consider myself as rather self aware, though my interoception can be quite poor sometimes. I often need a lot of time after an interaction to self reflect and consider what has happened in order for me to adequately process what has happened. I tend to categorise people, behaviours and experiences in a black and white manner as either good or bad, which I believe to be a limitation in my self and social awareness. I don't think I am a very socially aware person and often miss social cues in social situations. This leads to the formation of communication barriers and obstacles since I may not correctly interpret a question or comment.

## MY POSITIVE AREAS OF SELF REFLECTION AND HOW THIS BENEFITS MY WORK REGARDING INCLUSIVITY
I believe that because of my neurodiversity, I would be able to work with neurodiverse people on a more personal level. I also believe that since I have had mental health struggles and come from a specific culture, I would be able to relate to a niche group of people. I think that I am an empathetic person, almost to the point where it is detrimental to myself, so when I say that I'm feeling what they're feeling, I believe it. I think since I am so open to growth, self improvement, and learning more about the world I am able to work towards being as inclusive as I can.

## WAYS TO IMPROVE MYSELF AND SOCIAL AWARENESS
I am always on the prowl to try and improve myself and social awareness as I am aware this is one of my biggest weaknesses. In fact, I am taking this Diploma of Counselling so I can learn about social interaction and how to communicate effectively with other people.

Other ways to improve myself include increasing my self awareness and working on self nourishing behaviours instead of deprecating or harmful ones. Self nourishing behaviours could include physical self care like drinking enough water, eating consistently and getting the correct amount of sleep. Self destructive behaviours may look like punishing yourself for perceived incorrect behaviour. It is important to allow myself to make mistakes while learning about myself and society so that I can grow as a person and in turn, provide the support others need.
