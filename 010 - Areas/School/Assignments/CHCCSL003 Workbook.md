Activities
Complete the following activities individually or in a group (as applicable to the specific activity and the assessment environment).
Activity 1A
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand the client’s story and their perspective to assist the client to feel comfortable and express their concerns freely.
	How can you ensure you understand the client’s perspective when engaged in your client discussions?

When engaged in client discussions, you should utilise observational skills, micro skills, attending skills and specialised interview skills. Observational skills involve looking at body language cues and other non verbal cues to reinforce what the client verbalises. For example, check whether they are fidgeting to see if they are uncomfortable.

Micro skills in counselling involve open ended questioning, compound questioning and close ended questions. Open ended questions such as ‘How do you feel about xxx’ can be used to gain more insight and clarity, hence enhancing your ability to understand the client’s perspective, while compound questions and close ended questions retrieve a simple 1-2 word answer or a yes/no. All types of questioning are useful in making sure you understand the client’s perspective.

Attending skills and specialised interview skills involve making sure you are fully present and actively listening so you know what the client is saying, rather than thinking about what you are going to say next.


How can you help the client to feel comfortable and open to expressing their concerns?

You can help the client feel comfortable by approaching the session with an open minded and non-judgemental aura. Ensure that the client feels affirmed and continually reaffirm them throughout their speech by nodding along, making eye contact and leaning forward. Adjust your posture and turn of phrase to match theirs.

Ensure that the environment itself is also comfortable and non-confrontational. Make sure the temperature of the room is not too warm or too cold, they have a glass of water and a box of tissues available, and the lighting is not too harsh, or installing a white noise machine in the waiting area so they feel more secure in case of fear around privacy and confidentiality.


 
Activity 1B
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to look at client-presenting issues and their nature and depth, giving attention to the possibility of underlying issues.
	What is a presenting issue?

This is the issue the client brings to you as what they have observed about themselves. The example provided was having panic attacks on the bus on the way to work.



What are underlying issues?

Underlying issues are the issues that are responsible for the presenting issues – in this case, it could be to look at the reason why panic attacks were occurring. These are the source of the presenting issue and normally what needs to be rectified in order to improve the condition of the presenting issue.



How can you look deeper at the presenting conditions in order to determine their true cause?

You can look deeper at the presenting conditions to determine their true cause, AKA the underlying issues. Use observational techniques to uncover the root of the problem, such as examining any changes in behaviour or presentation. You could note their
-	Behaviour – any fidgeting, pacing, averting eye contact
-	Non verbal communication – facial expression to gauge mood, physical appearance – cleanliness, changes in clothing
-	Verbal communication – speaking more, or speaking less, or not speaking at all, speaking centred around a particular topic
-	Reaction to certain topics
-	Posture, where open posture = open arms and legs, relaxed, and closed posture = arms and legs crossed, no eye contact
-	Habitual behaviour like nail biting, scratching
-	Physical health
-	Content of speech in context of situation
-	Changes to memory
-	Attention
-	Judgement
These may all indicate
-	State of agreement
-	Wellbeing and emotions
-	Strength of relationship
-	Feedback
-	Thoughts
-	Flow of communication
 
Activity 1C
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to identify situations requiring immediate action.
	What situations within the workplace may you need to respond immediately to?

Some situations in the workplace you need to respond immediately to are those that put yourself or any others in danger. These can include
-	Presence of a fire
-	Presence of an unarmed threat
-	Presence of an unarmed threat
-	Verbal threats from clients or coworker
-	Physical violence from clients or coworkers
-	Leaking roof near electricity port
-	Breach in privacy and confidentiality via a data leak


What is mandatory reporting?

Mandatory reporting is a legal requirement that imposes a duty of care upon the workers to the wellbeing of those they interact with. Mandatory reporting requires a worker to inform relevant authorities when there is a threat to the wellbeing of anyone under their duty of care, including themselves. Mandatory reporting regarding a client may involve:
-	Informing a guardian that their child is suicidal
-	Reporting to a third party such as a disability service provider as to the progress of the client under your care on a regular basis
-	Reporting any signs of abuse or neglect of a child
-	Reporting any threats the client has imposed upon themselves or a third party

Mandatory reporting has different laws in every state and you should be aware of the laws in the state you are practicing in so you oblige with legal compliances.










 
Activity 1D
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand primary concerns in relation to presenting issues and how to prioritise concerns on which to work.
	How can addressing primary concerns help with client presenting issues?

Addressing primary concerns can help with client presenting issues as the presenting issues often have underlying issues that are the root of the problem. For example, a client may be experiencing panic attacks on the way to work, but the root of the problem is that work is stressful.

Addressing primary concerns targets the source of the issue and therefore you can work on strategies to cope with or change the situation which caused the cascade of other issues rather than fixing superficial problems. i.e. if the solution was to stop going to work on public transport, the issue is still there and has not been identified.



How can you prioritise client concerns when addressing the needs of the client?

It is important to prioritise client concerns when addressing the needs of the client because often a client will come with a list of unfocussed issues that are interlinked. Prioritising the most pressing issue will enable the client to feel more relieved and may also affect the other issues. You can prioritise client concerns when addressing the needs of the client by identifying which concerns need to be prioritised. 

You should ask questions to firstly check if the primal needs of the client are being met. These include a balanced diet, exercise, interpersonal connection, life meaning, purpose and goals, if they are part of a community and making contributions, challenge, creativity, intimacy, control, safety and status, and if they are giving and receiving attention. 

You can ask questions like
1. How often do you get to meet up with friends?
2. can you and your partner really talk?
3. Are you happy with your diet?
4. How much exercise are you getting?
5. How are you sleeping?
6. Who are you close to that really understand you?
7. What choice do you have in your life
8. Do you have a clear sense of where your life is going
9. Do you feel excited by things in your life
10. what involvement do you have with people in your life?
 
Activity 1E
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to consider the indicators of client issues requiring referral and how to report or refer appropriately in line with organisation requirements.
	Name three indicators of client issues that require referral.

There are many indicators of client issues that require referral
-	If the problems are out of your area of expertise
-	Dual relationships
-	Getting attached or attracted to client
-	Going through a similar issue as client
-	Therapy/other service is agreed upon by client
-	Counsellor is having difficulty with specific client issues
-	Client-counsellor relationship has not established or developed enough to enable successful counselling
-	Client shows little/no progress in counselling sessions












Describe your organisation’s (or an example of) reporting/referral process.

1.	Identify indicators of serious issue
-	This could be:
-	Withdrawal from family
-	Reckless behaviour
-	Changes to physical appearance
-	Talk of suicide
-	Neglecting responsibilities or self
2.	Identify who to refer a client to
-	Local hospitals
-	Police
-	Doctors
-	Suicide telephone life
-	Critical incident counsellors
-	Emergency accommodation
-	Emergency services
 
Activity 2A
Estimated Time	60 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to identify and work with uncertainty and ambivalence of clients; and support clients to experience and process difficulties.
	
a) Identify and explain two ways that you could see uncertainty or ambivalence in a client.

Uncertainty or ambivalence in a client may be observed in multiple ways

1.	Use motivational interviewing
Motivational interviewing is a method of talking to people about change. The most often reason of not changing is due to ambivalence, which leads to procrastination. You should obtain a spirit of compassion, acceptance and encourage client evocation. 

2.	Weigh the pros and cons of a certain situation
Guide the client through analysing the advantages of a situation in contrast to the disadvantages and use logical overviewing to guide the client towards certainty and away from ambivalence. Consult the stages of change model and analyse which stage the client is in to help them process the uncertainty or ambivalence.

b) Describe how you could use micro-skills and communication techniques to help the client process the uncertainty or ambivalence and alleviate their issues.

You can employ OARS interviewing in motivational interviewing

These include

Open ended vs simple vs Compound questions
-	Asking open ended questions like ‘how does this affect xxx’ as opposed to closed or compound questions helps collect more information

Affirmations
-	Reaffirm the client’s capabilities as you counsel them to encourage them to keep talking

Reflections 
-	As the client speaks, repeat back to them in a paraphrased manner what they have said which gives them a chance to reflect on what they have said and whether it is logical
Summarising
-	Recall what the client has said and give them a chance to correct your understanding of a situation

 
Activity 2B
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand parallels and links in a client’s experience; and identify interventions that have meaning for the client’s immediate situation and that are most likely to facilitate client understanding and actions.
	How can parallels and links affect client experiences?

Parallels and links are drawing connections from the client’ historical experiences and emotions or their family history. They can affect client experiences by helping them identify any recurring thoughts or patterns when presented with a particular situation.

For example, perhaps there is a family history of divorce and your client has just gotten a divorce – this is a parallel. An example of a link would be if a client had gotten a divorce and has had divorces in the past. Examining past experiences, parallels and links helps the client unearth any behaviour, actions, environments or other stimuli that in turn affect their situation on a holistic level.


How can you ensure that the correct type of intervention is used for assisting a client?

To ensure the correct type of intervention is used for assisting a client, you should assess the client on a holistic level. Ensure you are taking useful case notes, such as noting down any assessments, challenges, demonstration of skills or behaviour, explorations in diagnoses, symptoms or feelings, evaluation of consequences, abilitiy to identify triggers, labelling feelings patterns or behaviour, normalised experiences, reflections, and how they processed these situations. 

Use these case notes to determine whether your intervention type would be most useful if it were non-direct, direct, collaborative or systemic. Intervention techniques include visualisation, the empty chair, contingency management and voice dialogue.






 
Activity 2C
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to identify client strengths (known and previously unknown) and understand how these can be used by the client.
	How would you go about identifying the client’s known and unknown strengths?

You can go about identifying client’s known strengths by asking them. You can ask open ended questions surrounding a situation, such as ‘How did you react in this situation that you were proud of?’ or deliberately asking a compound question like ‘What are your strengths?’ Both these methods will uncover known strengths that can be used to help the client progress.

You can identify unknown strengths of a client by probing deeper and encouraging self evaluation and self reflection. Unknown strengths are strengths that the client is unaware of, and it could be that they don’t consider it a strength. Make sure you note if you suspect a strength of a client and use positive affirmation to ensure they realise it is a strength as well



How can these be used to help the client’s progress?

Identifying known and unknown strengths of a client can be used in multiple ways to help the client’s progress.

-	reinforce good habits and thinking
-	change behaviours 
-	change unhealthy routines
-	give client ability to reach goals
-	continue working on self outside of counselling sessions

Affirming the client’s ability to change enforces a positive outlook and encourages the client to be able to make the change in the first place. Through the intentional use of the client’s strengths, they will feel more empowered and be able to use coping strategies more effectively outside of a session, hence enhancing their function as a fully functioning human.










 
Activity 2D
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand how to perceive the client’s feelings through reflecting back, clarification and review.
	What skills can you use when reflecting back to the client?

There are two main methods that you can use when reflecting back to a client – mirroring and paraphrasing. 

Mirroring is repeating back to the client exactly what they have said, or key words and phrases. This gives the client a chance to consider what they have said and helps them realise any patterns in thinking or recurring thoughts.

Paraphrasing on the other hand is listening to a client’s speech and rephrasing what they have said. This helps the client see their situation in other words, and may help them view an alternative perspective.

Other skills that can be used include summarising, micro skills like attending skills, and specialist counselling skills specifically for motivational interviewing.

How does clarification and client review help the client’s progress?

Clarification and client review helps the client progress by allowing both the counsellor and client to reflect on any change that has occurred as a result of the counselling service. Review can be conducted every session as a mini review or as an evaluation after a number of sessions. 

It is important to reflect on progress as it gives a gauge on how much progress is achievable for the client and acts as a method of measuring growth. Client review is essential for the client to observe their progress in an objective manner.

Clarification helps the client progress by ensuring that the counsellor understands their situation to the fullest extend they can. By clarifying thoughts, situations and emotions, the counsellor is more able to guide the client through navigating their situation. By being more able to help with navigation, the client is guided to self evocation and helps the client progress by ensuring their independence by talking through their situation and strategizing for the future.



 
Activity 2E
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to address underlying issues where appropriate and identify ways of dealing with them; and acknowledge changes in client’s life as appropriate.
	How can you identify ways to deal with the client’s underlying issues?

There are many ways to identify ways to deal with client’s identifying issues. Firstly, you should assist the clients to become aware of underlying issues then identify ways of dealing with them.

Some examples of therapies are CBT, EMDR, ACT and Transpersonal Therapy.

CBT, also known as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is used for many disorders and is based on the concept that situations influence thoughts that cause a reaction and behaviour. Often, automatic thoughts are experienced after a situation occurs that impinges on a person’s core beliefs. The aim of CBT is to change cognitive processes via training and restructuring thought processes

EMDR, also known as Eye Movement De-Sensitisation and Reprocessing is another evidence based treatment aiming to remove the mental block as if it is a foreign object. This is commonly used in those who have PTSD. A therapist will move a light or pencil in front of the client’s eyes to simulate REM, a phase during sleep, and thus allow memories to be uncovered and explored.

ACT is acceptance and commitment therapy. It relies on the client being able to accept their thoughts of distress and commit to a healthier future – for example, a client who is overweight should acknowledge their thoughts and take action for the long term future to be healthier.

Transpersonal therapy involves making the person aware of themselves in the wider concept of reality. It involves ascending their consciousness using other senses such as perception. 



What type of changes may the client experience through the process of counselling? 

It is important to remember that during this therapy, clients may have
- emotional/behavioural crisis
- realisation and exploration of issues
- problem sollving
- understanding and acceptance
- changers within self
- liberation from issues/transformation



 
Activity 3A
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand the counselling review process with clients to ensure counselling remains of value.
	What is involved in monitoring and reviewing counselling sessions with clients?

There are several concepts involved in monitoring and reviewing counselling sessions. Counsellors should review client session work either every session as a mini review or every few sessions. 

It is important to review and evaluate what changes has been made, any self-evaluation and adjustment of end objectives.

In the monitoring and review process, there are a few things that should be determined. These can include if there has been any improvement within 2-3 sessions, if there has been any change or progress within 6-8 sessions and if any alternative or summative counselling services are to be required as well.

In the reviewing process, you could also evaluate yourself as a professional to determine what strategies have worked, what micro skills you need to develop, and what specialist counselling techniques are effective for working with a specific client.

Counselling review processes are essential with clients to ensure counselling remains of value and the client is comfortable with the progress they are making and the direction of the service.

Some counsellors may ask you to rate, for example, on a scale of 1-10 how well they felt listened to in a session at the end of every session, and on a scale of 1-10 how their wellbeing has been since the last session.

These strategies are a way to measure progress or falling behind, and also gives an opportunity for the client to make any complaints, queries or adjust their goals and expectations for the remaining sessions to be suitable to their needs.












Activity 3B
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to identify and threats and disruptions to the counselling process with clients.
	How can you determine if there are potential threats and disruptions to counselling with clients?

There are many ways to determine potential threats and disruptions to counselling with clients. You could outright ask the client if they perceive any potential threats, and use analytical skills during a counselling interview to note any areas that might cause an issue.



List two potential threats/disruptions that may occur under the following areas:

	Psychological barriers
-	Denial of a situation, problem, or the need to make change caused by several factors like fear of coming to terms with a situation, not giving a problem enough attention, believing problem shows weakness, and shame
-	Social stigma
-	Cultural stigma
	Physical barriers
-	Disability issues: such as hearing or speech disabilities may result in ineffective therapy. You could consider arts, music or animal based therapy to aid in their betterment
-	Rural and remote areas and those in the primary industry are more isolated from counselling services, and thus the Australian government offers counselling service funding for those who are struggling to find appropriate services.
	Economic barriers.
-	A client may perceive therapy to be an additional cost that is not beneficial enough to their health.
-	A client may not be able to afford long term mental health assistance if services in their area are economically unsustainable.
-	The Better Access to Mental Health Scheme involves the GP and Medicare company in Australia helping fund individual counselling services for those who are struggling financially.








 
Activity 3C
Estimated Time	10 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand perceptions and how these may differ.
	What are perceptions?

Perceptions are what an individual witnesses a situation, event, or person to be. It is their own interpretation of this situation that may differ from a logical reality, but is true to them. Perceptions can be clouded or off track for both the client and the counsellor.

Perceptions are the unique perspective of what can be experienced. It can be shaped by information available, past experience, emotions and other external factors. Perceptions are not inherently right or wrong and are the individual’s manner of thinking. They are not to be criticised and instead guided in an open and understanding manner.










Why can perceptions differ between the client and the counsellor?

Perceptions can differ between a client and counsellor for a range of reasons. Differences in perceptions could be due to perception being warped or clouded by past experience, different knowledge and beliefs, or different emotions. 

In order to achieve clarity and an understanding of each perception, the counsellor should lead with curiosity and employ micro skills and specialist counselling skills in a non-judgemental manner in order to understand how the client views the situation. 

Reframing is a technique that can be used in which the counsellor guides a client to view a situation from an alternative perspective to gain clarity and avoid emotional and psychological distortion. 

It is imperative that the counsellor does not come across as threatening or as if one perspective is ‘correct’ even if it is, because this may discourage the client from sharing their perspective which is required for progress to be made.



 
Activity 3D
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand tension between client’s hopes and expectations and the reality of resource limitations; and facilitate change at a pace the client can tolerate and assimilate.
	Provide five examples of how clients may display tension regarding their hopes and expectations for counselling?

-	Frustration
-	Excitement
-	Apathy
-	Increased energy
-	Anger
-	Disappointment


What resource limitations may impact on your client work?

-	allocated time for sessions
-	counsellor environment and facilities
-	Counsellor skills
-	Session activities
-	Homework
-	Medicare
-	Referral
-	Information for support organisations

How can you ensure that clients are comfortable with the pace of counselling and are able to assimilate changes?


-	In order to ensure that the clients are comfortable with the pace of counselling and are able to assimilate change, you should be monitoring the client’s progress and remaining mindful of the stages of change model. 
-	To monitor a client’s progress, you could conduct mini review or session reviews at regular intervals to reflect on any progress made, any changes, and if any adjustments to goals needs to be considered.
-	In order for the therapy to be effective, you should consider the stages of change model and at which stage the client is at.
-	The stages of change model has 5 stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and action.
-	Consider which stage they are in before progressing to a new technique or strategy


 
Activity 3E
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to recognise the appropriateness of ending counselling; and acknowledge, value and work with individual uncertainty in the counselling relationship.
	Name three indicators that counselling may be coming to an end for the client.

- understanding and acceptance has been reached
- new habits and healthy choices established
- positive actions taken by client
- resolution of issues




How can you ensure that counselling is ended appropriately with the client?
To ensure the counselling is ended appropriately with the client, make sure you have noted the indicators that the counselling has come to an appropriate end as listed above. Ensure the client does not feel as though they are being abandoned and continue to use micro-skills of counsel towards the end to affirm any emotions that may come from the ending of counselling. 

You should confirm with the client, if in their situation they have a limited amount of sessions with you, that they have appropriate resources and how to obtain further counselling or a referral if required and if they were to relapse into old habits.

If the client does not have a specified amount of sessions, ensure you do not exploit the client for financial gain and end the counselling when it is appropriate. You may choose to meet with the client less often if they do not wish to end counselling yet but you feel as though the sessions are less productive.

What should you do if the client displays signs of uncertainty with counselling?

If clients display signs of uncertainty, it is important you address these uncertainties with curiosity and in a non-judgemental manner. Barriers in the counselling process may be physical, psychological, cultural or social. You should take time to understand the concerns of the client and work with them to decide what to do next that is in their best interest. 

Be aware of the client’s non verbal communication that indicates any signs of uncertainty and express what you have perceived to gain clarification from the client as to their concerns and uncertainties about counselling.
 
Activity 3F
Estimated Time	25 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to understand ethical codes of conduct for addressing counselling dilemmas.
	What types of counselling dilemmas may you experience?

Relationships and family like family therapy, child counselling, break ups, and complex family situations
Ethics, values and boundaries like racist or offensive clients, conflict of interest between two clients, difficult client requests
Risk Situations like clients involved in crime, suicidal ideation, self harm, abuse or neglect of a children

Name two ethical principles from the PACFA Interim Code of Ethics, 2015.


The respect for humanity, worth and dignity to all people and promotion of this at work

To recognise and respect diversity and to work against discrimination and oppressive behaviour




How should human rights be incorporated into your counselling work?

You should underpin all counselling work with ethical code of conduct and consideration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consider the Australian Association of Social workers during social work and any commonwealth anti0discrimination laws.




What commonwealth anti-discrimination laws exist to protect individuals?

1.	Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986
2.	Age Discrimination Act 2004
3.	Disability Discrimination Act 1992
4.	Racial Discrimination Act 1975
5.	Sex Discrimination Act 1984

For Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people, you should also consider the Native Title Act 1993.

 
Activity 4A
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to enable client to identify when the process is approaching its conclusion; and enable client to identify, acknowledge and evaluate what is and is not changing, both in the counselling process and in their situation and understanding.
	Explain how you can bring awareness to the client that the counselling process is drawing to an end, and how you can assess with the client where changes have been made and have yet to be made.


You can bring awareness to the client that the counselling process is coming to an end by
- ensure client is aware of how many sessions they have left
- Discuss end of counselling is approaching
- reveiw progress
- highlight positive changes made by client
- assess tools and skills client has equipped
- determine any addition support needed
- asses if further services are required

Indicators that sessions are near the end are
- understanding and acceptance has been reached
- new habits and healthy choices established
- positive actions taken by client
- resolution of issues

At the end of sessions to verify when changes have been made and have yet to be made you could
- List achievements
- check objectives
- reassess client's situation
- confirm understandings

It is also important to conduct a counsellor self-evaluation to enable self-awareness about
1.	Role within organisation
2.	Limits of competence and responsibility
3.	Personal strengths and limitations
4.	Individual needs for support and supervision
5.	Impact of own beliefs


 
Activity 4B
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to use the ending process to enable client to understand the nature and impact of earlier issues.
	How can you help the client to understand the impacts of previous issues experienced in the counselling process?

To help the client understand the impacts of previous issues experienced in the counselling process, you should regularly conduct client reviews at regular intervals or as mini reviews.

In this review, you should include

-	What changes have been made
-	A counsellor self-evaluation
-	End objectives
-	Summarising sessions
-	Reframing events
-	Acknowledge and show respect for client’s immediate concerns

Ensure you use affirmations to affirm the client’s progress. You can also ask them to self-reflect. Aat the end of a client’s sessions you should

-	List achievements
-	Check objectives
-	Reassess client situation
-	Confirm understanding

Ensure you keep in mind that for most people the counselling service is finite, and issues can be resolved in a finite amount of sessions.

Throughout this process, ensure you are using micro skills and specialist counsellor interview skills to evaluate whether they understand the impacts of previous issuer experiences in the counselling process.

It is essential that the client understands what progress they have made so they can set standards and expectations for themselves as they navigate the world without the assistance of a counsellor. 

Ensure that the client is ready to  be a fully functional person and you have provided sufficient resources including referrals and further services that will help them should they relapse into old habits and bad behaviour.
 
Activity 4C
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to use boundaries of the counselling relationship to assist the ending process; and plan, structure and contract endings appropriately with client.
	Explain how you would plan, structure and contract endings, making sure that client-counsellor boundaries are followed.

Planning a contract ending
During earlier sessions, make sure that the client knows how many sessions they have left and be sure to discuss that the end of counselling is approaching. You should conduct regular reviews to evaluate any progress and as a chance to highlight any positive changes made by the client. You can also assess the tools and skills the client has equipped and determine if any additional support is required.

Indicators the client’s sessions should end are that an understanding and acceptance of their situation has been reached and they have taken continual positive action to resolve their issues.

Structuring endings
Structuring the final session and foretelling what this session will look like in final sessions. In the final session, you should use the opportunity to list achievements, check objectives, reassess client’s situations and confirm understandings.

Contract endings
To contract endiings you should conduct a counsellor evaluation survey in which the client answers a series of questions including
- Were client-counsellor boundaries maintained?
- Did the counsellor encourage the client to feel comfortable?
- Were discussions appropriately encouraged?
- Did the counsellor assess client needs correctly?
- Did the counsellor provide relevant and correct information?
- Did the counsellor allow the client to generate their own solutions?
- Did the counsellor show appropriate respect, dignity and empathy for the client?
- Did the counsellor make referral for additional support/care services (if needed)?






 
Activity 4D
Estimated Time	15 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to support client’s sense of autonomy during the ending process.
	What does client autonomy mean?

In the counselling context, client autonomy refers to 3 different aspects of autonomy. These include
1.	Attaining independent thinking
2.	Freedom to make decisions within the counselling process
3.	Control over direction and pace of counselling

Client autonomy can be supported by
-	Understanding the client’s frame of reference
-	Providing unconditional regard for their autonomy
-	Not forcing decisions or directions
-	Understanding that choices in life exist and support the client in decision making
-	Give objective explanations if suggestions are made to the client 


Why is it important to support the client’s autonomy through the process of counselling?

It is important to support the client’s autonomy throughout the process of counselling for a number of reasons. 

For one, you do not want the client to become dependent on you for emotional support. The end goal of counselling is to develop a fully functional human. This includes being able to act independently.

If the client were to become dependent on you, ending of the counselling sessions may become tricky as they have become reliant on you as an emotional support. 

By the end of the counselling sessions, the client should be able to support their own emotions independently given the skills and strategies implemented throughout the therapy.

It is thus important to support the client’s autonomy for ethical reasons and moral obligations.
 
Activity 4E
Estimated Time	20 Minutes
Objective	To provide you with an opportunity to address any opportunities for further support; and deal with unresolved issues of the client.
	What types of support can be used for after counselling?

There are many organisations that can be used as support afer counselling. These include
-	NDIS
-	Black Dog institute
-	REACH program
-	Grow Program
-	Lifeline
-	Relationship Australia
-	REACHOUT


Briefly research a support option and provide details of this.

Reachout.com provide online support for people up to 25 years old in the form of peer support and trained peer workers in an anonymous format. You can volunteer to be a reachout online community builder, in which you respond to general member posts on the forum to provide text-based peer support.

They are a free resource available for anyone who needs it, however in order to access 1:1 text support, you will need to make a booking. Reachout forums are divided into spaces such as ‘Relationships’, ‘Work and Study’ or ‘Heavy Feels’ and members of the community may post and vent whenever they want to get support from an online community.

There are guidelines as to what can be shared on this forum – since it is anonymous, members are not permitted to disclose any identifying information including their usernames to other platforms, for example. Additionally, any content that may be perceived as threatening will be deleted i.e. talk about current suicidal ideation. While these are deleted, a member of staff will reach out to contact the OP and collect any additional information to provide personal support.

Why do unresolved issues need to be addressed?

Unresolved issues are defined as current issues that are not fully addressed, additional identified but unaddressed issues, or issues that have recently surfaced. It is important that these issues are addressed so any additional support can be provided to the client before you never see them again. These resources could include the organisations listed about, affirming that they can access your support again in the future, or referring them immediately to another service provider for continuing support.
