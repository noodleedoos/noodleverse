### Activity 1A

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to explain clearly to clients the policy on record-keeping and confidentiality.|
||1.     Why is record-keeping and confidentiality important?<br><br>_Record keeping and confidentiality are both important during the counselling process. Record keeping refers to the documentation of any personal information divulged by the client during counselling sessions. Confidentiality refers to how this information is stored in a private manner._<br><br>_Record keeping is important because it allows the establishment of reputable client history obtained by the counsellor and any other parties. This subsequently allows for the development of documentation of any changes to the client’s behaviour, emotions, and overall wellbeing as well as any logistical information such as age, location and financial status._<br><br>_Confidentiality is important due to the privacy and confidentiality rights of the client. It enables the client to feel comfortable knowing that any information, to an extent is kept confidential and safe with the organisation, whether this be on physical documentation or the cloud._<br><br>_Both record keeping and confidentiality are important for establishing the client’s history and keeping it private and safe._<br><br>2.     List five types of confidential information.<br><br>Confidential information refers to any personal information gathered by the organisation about an individual in its care. This can include<br><br>-        Name<br><br>-        Age<br><br>-        Gender<br><br>-        Sexuality<br><br>-        Ethnicity<br><br>-        Nationality<br><br>-        Email<br><br>-        Phone number<br><br>-        Relatives<br><br>-        Occupation|

### Activity 1B

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to encourage clients to identify and explore their aims, requirements and ideas.|
||_List three ways to help clients identify their goals._<br><br>_Helping the client identify their goal is crucial to enabling the counselling process to be a beneficial one that aids in the growth and development of the client into a fully functional human._<br><br>_To help identify their goals, the counsellor will have a successful initial session. In this initial session, the counsellor should aim to gather a detailed personal history about the client, including any confidential information, details about life experience, past traumas if applicable and current issues._<br><br>_The counsellor should utilise specialist counsellor interview skills such as open ended, compound and simple questions to draw out any information required to gain a fuller perspective about the client and their issues. The counsellor may ask an open ended question such as – why have you decided to come to therapy, or a compound question such as what are your goals for therapy?_<br><br>_In addition to this, the counsellor will work with the client to establish a SMART plan – by setting goals that are specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and within a certain time frame. By setting goals that are smart, it is easier to monitor the client’s progress and set expectations for the remainder of the counselling session._<br><br>_To help a client identify their goals, a counsellor should also utilise micro-skills such as open body language, attending skills, summarising, paraphrasing, and reflecting skills. These skills aim to make the client feel comfortable to divulge more information about themselves and allow the counsellor to work with the client to identify their goals for therapy._<br><br>_Examples of goals could include_<br><br>_-_        _Be more confident when engaging in small talk_<br><br>_-_        _Leaving the house 5 times a week_<br><br>_-_        _Eating fruit once a day_<br><br>-        _Quit smoking within 6 months_|

### Activity 2A

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify collaboratively potential courses of action for meeting individual aims and requirements.|
||_List four methods/approaches to therapy._<br><br>_There are many methods and approaches to therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Individual Therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Cognitive behavioural therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Psychotherapy_<br><br>_-_        _Interpersonal therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Behavioural activation_<br><br>_-_        _Mindfulness based therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Family therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Group therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Couples therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Person Centred Therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Acceptance and commitment therapy_<br><br>_-_        _Eye movement de-sensitisation and resistance therapy_<br><br>_Cognitive behavioural therapy_<br><br>Also known as CBT, this approach is based on the concept that behaviours and actions directly affect the thoughts someone experiences. It aims to use logic and evidence to refute automatic thoughts that may not be factual in nature. It aims to retrain automatic thoughts.<br><br>Eye movement desensitisation and resistance therapy<br><br>This therapy is conducted by a trained therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist or other health professional. It invites the client to imagine a scenario of stress and discomfort while the therapist waves a pencil, or taps rhythmically. While it is unknown how exactly this works, it is an evidence based therapy that helps trauma holders.<br><br>Person centred therapy<br><br>This type of therapy is based on the concepts by carl rogers where it is believed that the client holds all the information to solve their problems. A therapist may use phrases such as ‘it makes sense why….’ Or ‘that reaction to this situation makes sense<br><br>Mindfulness based therapy<br><br>This type of therapy encourages the client to engage in the ‘here and now’. Clients are taught mechanisms and strategies like breathing techniques and guided meditation to help them stay in the moment. This type of therapy is often used to ease anxiety and stress.|

### Activity 2B

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify and explore factors which could influence the preference for, and ability to achieve, a course of action.|
||List five factors that could influence the client’s decided course of action.<br><br>Factors that could influence the client’s decided course of action include<br><br>-        Self confidence<br><br>-        Aptitude<br><br>-        Finances<br><br>-        Advice and anecdotal evidence from family and friends<br><br>-        Support from family and friends<br><br>-        Ease of access<br><br>-        Personal preference<br><br>5 of these will be discussed in further detail<br><br>Self confidence<br><br>A client who is less confident in their skills may opt for a therapy option that requires a more passive approach and less active engagement. For example, they may opt for guided meditation rather than self-led interoception. It is important that during the discussion of which therapy is most appropriate, any issues regarding self confidence are addressed and a decision is made that is fair and most beneficial to the client’s overall wellbeing.<br><br>Aptitude<br><br>Often, therapies will involve the use of the client’s own strengths. If a client is more familiar with a particular type of therapy, they may opt for this option and be less drawn to newer therapies or novel concepts. It is essential that you discuss each option in detail so the client knows what to expect.<br><br>Finances<br><br>Some therapies cost more than others, and while this may be a sensitive topic to discuss, it is an important factor to consider. For example, some therapies may require more sessions than another, and this may not be financially viable for the client.<br><br>Ease of access<br><br>Some therapies may only be accessible from certain providers that a client may not be able to reach due to travel constraints. It is important to consider all the resources the client may use and determine which would be the most efficient and beneficial for use.<br><br>Personal Preference<br><br>Some clients may be wary of certain therapies, such as clinical hypnosis or EMDR. It is important that you respect the client’s autonomy and respect their decisions. Approach all concerns with a non-judgemental attitude and strive for curiosity.|

The aim of family therapy is to achieve better communication and dispel any familial issues the family unit is experiencing. The methodology is to allow each member of the family time to speak and voice their opinion regarding their experience in home life.<br><br>Family therapy allows the development of a more cohesive family unit and strengthens the bonds between the family members. The methodology used in family therapy is similar to group therapy however is more interconnected since the family members likely live together.<br><br>3.     Describe group therapy.<br><br>Group therapy is a group of individuals and a therapist that all aim to solve a common problem. An example of group therapy is alcoholics anonymous. The aim of group therapy is to allow clients of a similar issue to tackle the problem together, inspire each other and bounce ideas of each other.
