# Task 3
## Strategy 1: Using Plain Language and Visual Aids
When communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, it is important to recognise that English might not be their first language. When speaking. you should aim to use jargon-free languagge that is clear so that communication can be effective. It is important to avoid technical terms and speak in plain accessible language. By doing so, you can help minimise misunderstandings. By incorporating visual aids such as maps, pictures and diagrams, we can enhance understanding of a given topic and overcome any language barriers. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have strong oral and visual traditions and as such, conveying information using such manners increases relatability and comprehension.

## Strategy 2: Active Listening, Respect For Silence
Active listening can be defined as hearing, listening and understanding what someone is saying. You should not interrupt or impose your own assumptions. When you are communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, you may notice some differences in communication such as the use of silence. Silence is a cultural norm in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communication. Silence is used as a time of reflection and additionally as a sign of respect. Do not pressure individuals to respond quickly, and do not feel as though you have to fill these gaps with dialogue. Practice patience, show genuine interest in their opinions, and build trust to have a respectful exchange.
