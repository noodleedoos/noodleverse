|                    | **Read each of the scenarios.**<br><br>**Complete the tasks that follow each of the scenarios.**<br><br>Scenario 1: Grief and Loss  <br>Jamie, a 35-year-old, recently lost his spouse to a long-term illness. Despite having been the primary caregiver and preparing for this outcome, Jamie finds himself struggling with intense sadness, guilt over feelings of relief, and anxiety about the future. He has a supportive family but feels isolated in his grief, unable to share his true feelings for fear of being judged.<br><br>Task (200 words):  As Jamie's counsellor, how would you acknowledge his complex emotions and support him through this period of grief and loss? Consider integrating empathy, sensitivity, and appropriate communication approaches that respect Jamie's current emotional state.  <br>You need to ensure that you provide a written explanation on how you would:<br><br>·       use empathic listening skills<br><br>·       use verbal and non-verbal techniques<br><br>·       provide information clearly and sensitively<br><br>·       obtain feedback to confirm understanding<br><br>To acknowledge Jamie’s complex emotions and support him through this period of loss and grief, I should utilise many speciality counsellor skills. I may use phrases such as ‘It’s completely normal to have these feelings of guilt over feelings of relief, anxiety and intense grief’. By saying this, I aim to normalise his emotions and help him feel less alienated and guide him towards self compassion. To integrate empathy, I should consider how Jamie is feeling and how we can develop healthy coping strategies in an appropriate time frame. To integrate sensitivity, I will speak in a comforting and soft tone, regulate my dynamic value and ensure I affirm his feelings and thoughts. To communicate appropriately, I should ensure I allow Jamie plenty of time to think and be okay with silences. I should not interrupt Jamie unless it is absolutely necessary and give him space to process his feelings.<br><br>Verbal techniques I can use include affirmation, paraphrasing and summarising.<br><br>Non verbal techniques I can use are observing his body language while we are in session, mirror this body language, and lean forward to show interest. To confirm my understanding, I should obtain feedback. This can be done by regularly asking Jamie if my understanding of a situation is accurate.<br><br>Scenario 2: Simple Trauma from Loss  <br>Alex, a 22-year-old college student, witnessed a tragic car accident resulting in the death of a close friend who was a passenger in Alex's car. Alex sustained minor physical injuries but is experiencing flashbacks, avoidance of cars, and feelings of guilt. His academic performance is suffering, and he is withdrawing from social activities.<br><br>Task (200 words): As Alex's counsellor discuss how you would identify and suggest strategies for both formal and informal support, taking into account Alex's social environment. Also, how would you identify and deal with any health risks or safety issues with Alex (including suicide)?  <br>You need to ensure that you provide a written explanation on how you would:<br><br>·       use empathic listening skills<br><br>·       use verbal and non-verbal techniques<br><br>·       provide information clearly and sensitively<br><br>·       obtain feedback to confirm understanding<br><br>It is important to ensure we take Alex’s social environment into consideration when identifying and suggesting strategies for formal and informal support. Formal supports may look like referring Alex to a specialist in trauma, debriefing a situation, or implementing certain therapies to cope with the traumatic incident. Informal supports may look like debriefing with friends and family of Alex, sharing emotional support with other affected parties, or self care.<br><br>To identify and deal with any health risks or safety issues with Alex including suicide, I could conduct suicide risk assessment and check for any behaviour that may be linked to the traumatic event such as self harm or isolation. It is important that when talking to alex, I use empathetic listening skills which may come in the form of non-verbal techniques like nodding and making eye contact.<br><br>I should provide information on the formal and informal support in a sensitive manner, being wary of how much time Alex needs to process the incident. I should ask Alex questions surrounding his safety to confirm his mental wellbeing. It is important to note any triggers like cars and avoid inflicting unnecessary damage when obtaining information and feedback. I may provide information in the form of writing to ensure it is clear and he is able to share it with his peers if needed.<br><br>Scenario 3: Bereavement  <br>Maria, a 60-year-old Italian born widow with limited English, is mourning the loss of her husband of 40 years. Since his death six months ago, she has shown little interest in activities she used to enjoy and has become increasingly withdrawn, expressing feelings of emptiness and a lack of purpose. Her children, who live in different cities, are concerned about her well-being.  Before Maria’s husband’s death she was an active member of the local Italian community and both Maria and her husband were both members of the local Catholic Church.<br><br>Task (200 words): As Maria's counsellor, how would you assist her in navigating her bereavement? Consider how to provide information about grief and bereavement support services and resources and suggest strategies for Maria to re-engage with her interests and community. Also, how would you identify and deal with any health crisis or safety issues with Maria (including suicide)?  <br>You need to ensure that you provide a written explanation on how you would:<br><br>·       use empathic listening skills<br><br>·       use verbal and non-verbal techniques<br><br>·       provide information clearly and sensitively<br><br>·       obtain feedback to confirm understanding<br><br>It is important that when navigating Maria’s bereavement, we engage in using empathetic listening skills and be aware of her cultural differences. I could ask Maria about the rituals in Italian or Catholic culture surrounding the passing of her husband. It would also be beneficial to note down any support networks we could build for Maria in this difficult time like the church, the Italian community and the children.<br><br>When asking about safety issues including suicide, it is important to be culturally conscious and provide information clearly and sensitively. You should obtain feedback from Maria regularly in each session regarding her mental wellbeing stability and any behaviours that could be linked to the passing of her husband. It is important to note that Maria is showing signs of complex grief since she is losing a husband of 40 years and monitor the progression of any depressive symptoms.<br><br>Be aware of any cultural stigma surrounding mental health issues, medication and suicide when conversing with Maria. To make her feel more comfortable talking to you, you should build rapport by mirroring body language and speech patterns.<br><br>When suggesting re-engaging in interests, it is important to listen to Maria and her concerns about re-engaging, and any obstacles that will need to be uncovered. It is essential that you talk through her qualms and respect her autonomy as a person. |
