**What questions should you ask yourself before sourcing information about personality and development theories? Provide examples of the types of sources you may require.**


There are many questions you could ask yourself before sourcing information about personality and development theories. Please consider:
- Reliability - are results accurate and precise
- Replication - can others find similar results
- Validity: measurement - is unit of measurement appropriate and reflective
- Validity: internal (variables and limitations)
- Validity: external - generalisation beyond specific context
 - Fairness - acknowledgement of different perspectives
- Ontological authenticity - increase understanding of own social conditions
- Educative authenticity - increase understanding of other social conditions
- Catalytic authenticity - increase drive for change of own social conditions
- Tactical authentic - provided resources to drive change in own social conditions

- Credibility - believability/plausibility
- Transferability - to other contexts
- Dependability - to other studies
- Confirmability - biases
Examples of sources you may require are research papers, peer reviewed studies, websites, youtube videos, course documentation and essays.

**Describe the empiricist perspective on genetic inheritance and human development.**

Empiricists believe that there is little influence of genetics and inheritance, unlike the nativists on human development. While genetic inheritance may have a smaller role in human development, empiricists dominant belief is that development of the mind is based strongly on experimentation and experience, as indicated by the etymology of the word. For example, a infant's development of social skills would be more based on how often a parent would spend talking to the infant rather than an inherent ability to comprehend speech from an early age.

**How could you apply Maslow’s ‘hierarchy of needs’ theory to counselling procedures? Use examples based on levels within the hierarchy.**

Maslows Hierarchy of needs has 5 levels
1. Physiological Needs
2. Safety
3. Love and Belonging
4. Esteem
5. Self Actualisation

In counselling procedures, you may want to consult this theory to ensure a client's more basic needs are met before moving onto the presenting issues. For example, a person may be feeling extremely fatigued and depressed and attribute it to the difficulty of social encounters, when it could be that they aren't getting enough sleep or eating enough food (physiological needs). You could also address safety concerns first, like ensuring a client has appropriate housing before helping them improve their relationship with their mother. Once a person has physiological and safety needs met, then they can work on these relationships as fits into the 'Love and beloniging hierarchy'. These can be applied further up.
