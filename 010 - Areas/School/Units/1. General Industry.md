# Intended Learning Outcomes

**Describe major Australian and international extensive animal production industries (beef cattle, dairy cattle, sheep, camelids and goats), the common production systems within them and the major determinants of profitability, productivity and sustainability**   

gcILOa : Describe the major components of agricultural production systems; inputs and outputs and how management decisions impact these.

gcILOb: Detail common providers of inputs and output services in extensive livestock systems and the role of veterinarians

gcILOc: How is animal health and welfare defined in livestock systems in Australian and around the world

gcILOd: Compare different extensive livestock production systems in Australia with respect to size, profitability, productivity and sustainability

gcILOe: What role do research, development and extension bodies have in extensive animal production, what is the overall structure of these bodies and what roles do veterinarians fulfill in them

gcILOf: Compare and contrast Australian production systems to international production systems for extensive livestock species
[[1.2 - Worldwide size of livestock Population]]

**Describe the basic principles of breeding, management, nutrition, animal welfare and disease control as they relate to extensive animal production systems and specify where veterinary input may be important**     
gcILOg : How do extensive animal production systems replace animals that are culled or die and what factors influence changes in this rate?

gcILOh : Describe the importance of gestation and lactation on matching feed supply and demand on a property.

gcILOi: What ratio of male and female young are required to retain for breeding and why in extensive livestock systems?

gcILOj : What is the range of ages/weights when different extensive livestock species are mated and how is this chosen?

gcILOk : How does seasonality impact breeding in different species and breeds?

gcILOl : How many times are extensive livestock mated per year and how many young are expected per mating?

gcILOm : What major factors impact reproductive success in different livestock enterprises and how may a veterinary examination improve survival?

gcILOn : What primary factor/s drive the decision on time of joining (natural or artificial) and therefore timing of parturition?

gcILOo : Compare and contrast why differing farm management systems sell livestock at varying ages and weights.

gcILOp : Compare at what age and weight livestock are weaned from their dams and/or source of milk and what factor/s influence this decision?

gcILOq : Describe the influence of pasture quality and quantity on management decision making and how this varies with geography/climate.

gcILOr : Detail the decision making process for commencement of supplementary feeding of livestock and relevant feedstuffs/requirements

gcILOs : Draft a calendar of management for various livestock enterprises based on environmental variables such as rainfall/temperature and/or pasture growth curves.

gcILOt : Detail likely anthelmintic and vaccination protocols for livestock enterprises as part of annual management.

gcILOu : Detail the process of fibre collection and reasons for timing of this in different livestock enterprises.

gcILOv : Utilise stocking rate equations to assess appropriate stocking rate of properties in different geographic/climatic regions

**Describe the ethical and legal frameworks that govern the major extensive livestock industries in Australia in order to understand the role of the various players, including veterinarians, in assuring the safe, ethical and legal production of food and fibre products**

gcILOw : What are the main legal frameworks that govern extensive livestock industries in Australia and how does this differ between states and regions?

gcILOx : How are veterinary chemicals regulated and by whom and what role do veterinarians play in this?

gcILOy : Define the terms withholding period and export slaughter interval for veterinary drugs and where this information may be obtained.

gcILOz : How is animal welfare legislation formulated and what are the key principles in livestock farming systems?
