## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Identify regions of the body by their anatomical name in domestic and novel species, necessary to communicate in an effective way.
[[Body Regions]]

- Describe the position and relationships of the major systems in relation to the major bones of the quadruped skeleton and in relation to each other, so they can be found in any animal you are presented with.
- Identify major structures of the major systems by their anatomical name and relative position, to facilitate communication about these body systems.
- Find selected structures from a written description and/or their anatomical name, a necessary skill in a veterinary career, for example to follow instructions to perform a surgery.
