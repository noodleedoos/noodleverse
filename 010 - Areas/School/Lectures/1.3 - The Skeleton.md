## Intended Learning Outcomes

**At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:**

- Describe the position, relationships, form, and appearance of the major bones of the quadruped skeleton, information used to understand the skeleton scaffold within the body, radiography, and as landmarks during clinical procedures.
- Identify the major bones in novel animals, as not all animals treated by veterinarians will be domestic species.
