## Risks on Large animal properties
~

Animal welfare risks - bites/needle sticks
Sheep jumping out end of race
cattle moving into raceway
Animal bites

## Preparation for placements
*How can you prepare for EMS on placement?*
~
- research - facilities, medical assistance location
	- OHS issues, likely risks
- Emergency gear - medical kit
- What3words - send location to anyone
