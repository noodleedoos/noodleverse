## Setting
- Carriage -> [[The Flaming Maw]]

## Timeline
- [[Help the Butler]] prepares breakfast and wakes the party - [[Alistair]] from his bed, [[Gluth Dur'an|Gluth]] from the bathtub and [[Rick]]from under the bathtub. They are alerted they are almost there.
- [[Gluth Dur'an|Gluth]] had a dream last night in which he conducts a ritual that allows him to speak
- [[Help the Butler]] gives 14 mice to [[Rick]], a bucket of sardines to [[Gluth Dur'an|gluth]]and [[Barnie]], and a big meal for [[Alistair]] (chips cooked in aioli with a side of aioli, 4 martinis, 2 steaks and bone marrow with parsley)
- [[Help the Butler]] gives an [[Elven bag of Holding]] to [[Rick]], Locathah Artifact of Circlet of Liquid Insight to [[Gluth Dur'an|gluth]] and a Self Destruct bomb to [[Alistair]]
- The train stops, the party exists into the hot desert platform. they reach a fork in the path and meet a hill dwarf with a map leading to [[The Flaming Maw]] that does not have a fork mapped. The dwarf turns to the right but the party goes straight.
- They reach a damp and darkened sandy area with armor and no people - [[Gluth Dur'an|Gluth]]determines the sand may be danagerous, to which [[Alistair]]kicks it around and [[Rick]] grabs it to make a sandcastle - it is a Black Pudding.
- They short rest then reach a clearing where there is piles of bodies. Gluth hides behind a pile of bodies and [[Rick]] and [[Alistair]] engage in mechanical combat with the cadaver collector
- They retrieve the map from the now-dead dwarf and queue up for entrance into a metal mineshaft. 
- The party declares they are here to find [[Bale the Dwarf|Bale Fizzle-Helm the Dwarf]], and they enter [[The Flaming Maw]]
