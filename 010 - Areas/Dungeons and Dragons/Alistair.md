A long long time ago it all started when Grom was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road. And then all of a sudden there shined a shinning demon, in the middle of the road. And he said.! Play the best song in the world or I’ll eat soul, but Grom couldn’t play the best song in the word as his travelling duo partner had just died. He tried nevertheless, he played for 14 hours and 14 minutes. But it wasn’t enough, just as the demon was eat Grom’s soul he begged the beast to spare him. Fortunately for Grom the devil is feeling very generous that night. Exchange for the greatest musical talent the dwarf would have to spend eternity performing for the Demon after his death.

After enjoying the talent Grom had gotten, the weight of the situation put down on him. He must get out this deal now! Grom found a loophole in the deal, a child of his could kill the beast. First idea is to find holy people to bang, with not much luck. The greatest of which traveled to stromwreck island. At wits end he thought about the strongest people who knew. Sorcerers! It was the key, for sure not to fail.

To find and get the support of sorceress was an easy task for the dwarf for his endless musical talent had spreader throughout the world and earned him many riches.

After a few years Grom had four children; Alec, Alistair, Annabel and Ashley. These 4 had shining promise. Capable of casting spells at a young age that wizards only dream of, the mastery of cantrips was superb. All the finest clothes and finest food, these kids had it all power, money and status. But one was not like the others, Alistair. At every point his siblings succeeded, he seem to fall short. Unable to cast the most basic of spells, and feeling to grasp the concept of cantrips. He was a failure. But not disheartened Alistair wanted to prove to his parents that he was not a waste of space. Practising all sorts of musical, artistic, combat and mathematical studies becoming proficient in many many things, but it was never enough. Alec, Annabel and Ashley constantly mocked him for this constantly making fun of him and being general nuisances to Alistair. Putting hair in his food at meals, tripping him up at training
