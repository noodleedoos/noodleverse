In the vault, [[Mr Bets]] and [[Rawry]] tried to pick the locks and we were charged with a taskto infect [[Deatrick Dark-arms]] with a modified mind flayer parasite. They were dropped through a portal in the floor into a prison. A magic dampener was put around their necks and they split up to find out information about deatrick.

[[Rawry]] went to the kitchen to work, Ivan rocked back and forth in the corner singing as song. [[Rawry]] poured soup over her kitchenmate after lighting her on fire and the party tried to punch the guard. They woke up in a cell where their wounds were being tended by the healer. They were in th same cell as deatrick. They ended up not deciding to give the parasite and teamed up with him to trick the duegar guard and they were let out to the gantry. 

The group, undercover in a prison, was sent by Kerbal from Couples Row. They tried to convince a guard that they were infected with a parasite that would compel them to follow orders. The guard, skeptical of their story, is forcibly infected by the parasite, causing his gruesome death. They find a note on his body instructing them to use rune magic to attune to a teleportation room to return to Kerbal. They begin drawing runes on the floor, which light up with powerful magic, preparing for the next step in their mission

The group, led by Dietrich, activates a portal and teleports to the emperorâ€™s barracks. They quickly unlock magic-dampening collars and disguise themselves using magic. Alarm bells ring, and they join the guards heading to the emperor, where they are assigned to squads to find escaped prisoners. The disguise spell breaks during an argument with the emperor, revealing their true identities, and they are restrained by runic magic.

The emperor expresses extreme disappointment and questions the group's loyalty, using magic to control Dietrich and revealing his family as leverage. Dietrich resists initially but is forced to comply when a parasite is introduced, making him convulse while the guards close in on his family. The group is then lowered into a dark, sand-covered arena with high stone walls and iron bars, where they find their equipment and prepare for the next challenge.

After entering the arena and retrieving their equipment, the group notices an empty iron throne descending from the viewing platform. The doors on the opposite side of the arena open to reveal a dark hallway. Suddenly, the body of Kobold Row the Magnificent is dropped into the arena, showing signs of a brutal attack. As they inspect the body, a mind flayer descends, revealing that the runes placed on Kobold Row failed to prevent his transformation. The mind flayer offers the group one favor and opens a small gap in the iron dome above them, suggesting a potential escape route. The key piece is lyng in place on a ledge higher tahn you can jump

The group stands in the arena, contemplating escape as the mind flayer opens a small gap in the iron dome and reveals a key piece hidden in the iron throne. However, the mind flayer dismisses the group, mentioning he has no time for vengeance, and flies away. As the group plans their next move, they hear heavy footsteps and see glowing green eyes approaching from the dark hallway, revealing a large iron-clad bull breathing green mist, signaling the start of a new combat challenge.
