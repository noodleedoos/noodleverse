## Backstory

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

Except there was a mouse, a family of mice, in fact. Mrs. Roll had just given birth to a litter of baby mice, but one of them looked a little... different.

And hungry.

Before Mr. and Mrs. Roll could react, the strange baby mouse unhinged its jaws and consumed his littermates. His parents stood in horror, unable to move. The baby mouse licked his lips then turned to face them.

'Rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick', he chittered.

Mr. Roll picked up Mrs. Roll and scampered away as quickly as he could, but alas, he was no match for the strange mutant child. The Rolls succumbed to him, and the baby mouse, now sated, fell asleep.

The baby mouse was rudely awoken by a large man, dressed in red and white.

'Why hello little cricket!' the figure said.

'Rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick.'

The man smiled and laughed warmly. 'It's nice to meet you, Rick! I'm Santa! Merry Christmas!'

'Rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick.' the mouse replied.

'A bedtime story?' Santa said, 'Sure, I have time for that!'

Santa placed a necklace around Rick's neck, picked him up and placed him on his lap.

'Let's see... Ah! How about this one?' Santa pulled out a book from his pouch: How to become a monk of four elements.

Rick nibbled the corner of the book, but it didn't taste very good. The man began to read the manual, cover to cover.

Rick's stomach growled. It seemed Rick's metabolism was working too quickly. He needed to refuel - and fast. Rick tried to scurry away, but alas, the man was too fast. He grabbed him and put it in his pocket.

Enraged, Rick said, 'Rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick.'

To his surprise, someone chittered back. He reached out his paw - another mouse! Rick began to salivate - a delicious snack, just for him.

Upon hearing the sound of bones crunching, Santa abruptly stopped reading.

'Rick? What are you doing?!' He pulled Rick out of his pocket, and to his horror saw Rick's whiskers covered in blood.

'DID YOU EAT MY PET MOUSE? TO HELL WITH YOU!' Santa began to cry, and threw Rick across the room in exasperation. Rick's leg hit the wall and was torn off.

Rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick-rick.' he shouted angrily.

Rick, now armed with a necklace and the knowledge of how to become a monk of four elements scampered away as best he could on his remaining three legs to hide.

He lived as a street urchin, breeding mice to eat and sate his cannibalistic inclination. He trained hard to become a monk of four elements, practicing every day to master control of natural material.

Yet one question remained unanswered - What had the man that night meant, "To Hell with me?". Rick pondered. All he could remember was the man dressed in red was the cause of his lacking limb, and his name was... what was it again? Sonte? No... Sannan?...

Oh! That's right!

Satan!

From then on, Rick has been on a quest to find the character who took his Arm from him. And kill him.
