Basically....  
  
Style depends on:  
1. Resolution.  
2. Proportions (chibi/cartoon or realistic)  
3. Number of colors in palette (could be as low as 2 or 4, and can go up to 256)  
4. Visual style when it is discernable (realistic, anime, vector-based, etc).  
5. Point of view (top, side, isometric, or tilted)
