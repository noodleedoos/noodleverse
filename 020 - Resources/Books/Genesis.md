## Questions
**Genesis 1:1 says God made the Heaven, but then 1:8 says God seperated the waters and called an expanse heaven. Where did the water come from?

**Why did He make heaven twice?**
> [!bible] [Genesis 1:1 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/1/1/)
> 1. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

*Interpretations*
1. In Hebrew, 'skies' is always plural. The separation refers to expanses to above and below the sky i.e. ice in space OR clouds
2. In Hebrew *haeshaemayim* = heavens, which contains the letters *Mem* meaning water i.e. heavens is where water is stored, not Heaven where we go

1. It could be argued that different earths were also created. #notetoself - explore [[Multiple Earths Matryoshka Theory]]
2. Heaven is only capitalised in 1:1, then later they talkl about multiple heavens which could refer to *haeshaemayim*
3. When Genesis was written, the authors didn't know about the concept of planets, so it is likely earth could be referring to soil and the water that comes with it

1. Genesis 1:1 is an indicate statement - in Hebrew *Barā* = create ex nihilo. The rest of the days are Him sculpting

> [!bible] [Genesis 1:4 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/1/1/)
> 4. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.

If i had to apply this to now I would say something about racism. But also, light as in light is good. How did He make light without the sun? I guess He can do whatever

> [!bible] [Genesis 1:16 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/1/1/)
> 16. And God made the two great lights — the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night — and the stars.

And the lesser night is dependent on the greater day light....

> [!bible] [Genesis 2:9 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/1/2/)
> 9. And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

I like how He puts the pretty things there for man
