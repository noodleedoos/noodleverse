**Client 3 Session 1 - Alistair**

**Self Reflection:**

I have been working with mock client Alistair Grom in regards to boosting his self confidence and adopting healthy coping strategies. I used communication techniques like paraphrasing, active listening and reflecting. By using techniques like these I feel like I was able to show empathy for the client and work with him to have productive sessions. I feel like we were able to have positive outcomes like increased self confidence, active reflection and self awareness. To improve on my communications in the future I may want to take more notes so I don't forget what I was going to say.
