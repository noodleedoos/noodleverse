# Client 1
Name: Maximillian Gremple
I determined the needs of my client by letting them talk about what they were feeling and what their current living situation is like. I used strategies such as empathy and shared my knowledge about available resources that could help him through his situation. We set the goal of improving his current living conditions so he can focus on himself.

# Client 2
Name: Nathan 
I determined the needs of my client by actively listening to what they concerns and worries were about upcoming university pressures. I used strategies like paraphrasing and non verbal communication techniques to ensure I was understanding his situation correctly. We talked about learning about different grounding techniques and breathing techniques to help them towards their aspiration of more productive study time.

# Client 3
Name: Bob
I determined the needs of my client by asking him open ended questions as to his situation and let him share the details he was comfortable with. I expressed empathy and provided resources to meet the needs and aspirations of Bob as we worked through his trauma around trams. I provided information about therapy groups within his demographic that could aid in helping him feel less alone and more comfortable expressing his needs.
