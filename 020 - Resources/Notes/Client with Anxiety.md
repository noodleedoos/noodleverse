# **TASK:**

## **Conduct a full counselling session** **with a mock client who struggles with Anxiety.**

**You must** **i****ntegrate CBT and at least one other of the theoretical approaches below to develop programs for behaviour change with your clients.  
  
In this submission you are required to upload the recording of your full session with a mock client who struggles with Anxiety.**

**Your session should be between 40 and 50 minutes.**

_There should be evidence that you have considered which theory is most appropriate to the client. Identifying which theory could be used to improve the situation of the individual may involve reading through prior case notes and counselling history, as well as interviewing the person about their life experiences and current issues._ 

_For example, if there is evidence that the client experienced detachment from parents in their early years, Bowlby’s attachment theory could be integrated into counselling work, while if you can identify a ‘maladaptation’ or ‘malignancy’, Erikson’s theory could improve clients understanding about their condition._[[Erick Erikson]]

_You will need to make decisions on which theoretical approaches are suitable. This should be done by analysing the client’s modelling influences, responses to modelling and reinforcement, and the effects of their environment. Relevant theoretical approaches may include stimulus and response techniques, and either positive or negative reinforcement. These should be done in accordance with legal and ethical restrictions. You should also monitor and record all progress in accordance with organisational requirements._

**In each case, you must show the ability to identify exact issues and choose appropriate therapies which have been proven to work, along with the correct skills and techniques to suit the situation.**

## **ASSESSMENT TIP**

**_Mock Client with anxiety issues_**

_You should use an individual therapy to treat the mock client. CBT should usually be the first therapy that you implement, as this has been proven to help anxiety sufferers. Using CBT you may use psycho-education, changing thoughts, feelings and behaviours, etc.  
Remember to use one other therapy in your session, such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Erickson's psychosocial changes._

**PLEASE NOTE:**

**1. Simulations** **need to be completed in a context that reflects real workplace conditions with a mock client.**

**2. You cannot use a script (you wouldn't use a script in a real clinic)**

**3. Your mock client must be in the same room as you for this assessment (recordings where the mock client is not in the same room will be returned as Unsatisfactory)**
