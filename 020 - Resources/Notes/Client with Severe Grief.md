[You can use the template provided (click here to](https://connect.app.axcelerate.com/ax/v2/resources/468754) [download the template)](https://connect.app.axcelerate.com/ax/v2/resources/468754)

**PLEASE NOTE:  
Across the four video submissions you must integrate at least three different theories.  That is the assessor needs to know that you have used three theories.  However, only one theory (apart from CBT) per video submission.**

_**For example:**_

**Session 1 – MockClient with anxiety – Erickson’s psychosocial stages & CBT**

**Session 2 – Mock Client with grief – Bowlby’s attachment theory & CBT** [[Bowlby's Attachment Theory]]

**Session 3 - Mock Client with family issues – Nature verse nurture & CBT** [[Nature vs Nuture]]

**Session 4 – Mock client with self-esteem issues - Erikson’s psychosocial theory + CBT**

_There should be evidence that you have considered which theory is most appropriate to the client. Identifying which theory could be used to improve the situation of the individual may involve reading through prior case notes and counselling history, as well as interviewing the person about their life experiences and current issues._ 

_For example, if there is evidence that the client experienced detachment from parents in their early years, Bowlby’s attachment theory could be integrated into counselling work, while if you can identify a ‘maladaptation’ or ‘malignancy’, Erikson’s theory could improve clients understanding about their condition._

_You will need to make decisions on which theoretical approaches are suitable. This should be done by analysing the client’s modelling influences, responses to modelling and reinforcement, and the effects of their environment. Relevant theoretical approaches may include stimulus and response techniques, and either positive or negative reinforcement. These should be done in accordance with legal and ethical restrictions. You should also monitor and record all progress in accordance with organisational requirements._

**In each case, you must show the ability to identify exact issues and choose appropriate therapies which have been proven to work, along with the correct skills and techniques to suit the situation.**

## ASSESSMENT TIP
