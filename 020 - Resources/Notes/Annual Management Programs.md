# Things to consider
~
1. Timing of reproduction
2. Nutritional needs vs. pasture supply
3. Time and length of mating - [[Soundness exam]] and [[Reproductive fitness exam]].
4. When to wean
5. [[Stocking Rate]]

# Beef Cattle Example
*Compare and contrast why differing farm management systems sell livestock at varying ages and weights.*
~
In western Australia,
Tradition: calve early autumn, sell vealer end of spring.
Outcome: Supplementary feed required for cows, meat production per hectare limited. Might grow faster but at what cost?
Swap calving to late winter = better feed supply:nutritional demand
- reduction in [[Grass tetany]] and [[Milk fever]]
- More beef per hectare
- wean calves as grass reduces and grow on supplementary feed
(cheaper to supplementary feed calves than cows)
