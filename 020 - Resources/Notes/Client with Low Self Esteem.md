## **ASSESSMENT TIP:**

**_Client who is struggling with low self-esteem_**

_You should use individual therapies to interrupt the mock client’s negative thought cycle and teach them ways to recognise negative thoughts and challenge them. You may also try to gradually build the mock client’s confidence using gradual exposure techniques._

**PLEASE NOTE:**

**1. Simulations** **need to be completed in a context that reflects real workplace conditions.**

**2. You cannot use a script (you wouldn't use a script in a real clinic)**

**3. Your mock clients must be in the same room as you for this assessment (recordings where the mock client is not in the same room will be returned as Unsatisfactory)**
