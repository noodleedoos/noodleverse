# Overview
~
Release the secretory product (e.g. milk, mucus, sweat) via a system of ducts that open onto of the surfaces of the body which are in contact with the external world (skin, respiratory tract, etc).

# Morphology
~
- tubular glands
- Acinar glands (no clear lumen)
- Alveolar glands (clear lumen)
- [[Compound Glands]]
