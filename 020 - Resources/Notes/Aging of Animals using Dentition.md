# 4 Factors affecting the accuracy of aging
~
- Breed of animal
- Malocclusion
- Filing/trimming
- Dietary, environment and behavioural causes
<!--SR:!2025-03-12,2,248-->

# Dog Teeth aging
*What happens to dog teeth as they age?*
~
- Triscupid points on incisors, canine points worn away
<!--SR:!2025-03-11,1,228-->

# Horses
*9 Criteria used to age horses in order of accuracy*
~
1. Changes in occlusal morphology of permanent incisors
2. Star
3. Cup
4. Occlusal Surface changes
5. Upper core incisor shape - useful after 5 years
6. Curvature of dental arch of lower incisors
7. Angle of incisors
8. Hook on upper incisor (irrelevant - not associated with any age)
9. Galvayne's groove (groove in labial surface of upper corner incisor, now uselesss)

*Changes to horse incisors over time*
~
1. Deciduous: smaller than permanents, white crown
2. Permanent: large/rectangular, yellowish crown from cementum
3. Cross section of incisor chages position and shape starting from centrals to corners, from oval mediodistally to trapezoidal to triangular then oval in the labiolingual direction

*Changes to the shape and angle of the upper corner incisor over time*
~
- 5-9 years - crown stout
- 9-10 years - crown square
- 10+ years - crown tall
- lower incisors become more oblique, caudal angle becomes smaller

*Changes to the curvature of the dental arch of lower incisors*
~
Semicircle to straight
Caudal angle becomes smaller

# Ox teeth aging
*What is used to determine age? How does the shape of teeth change? What are the stages of teeth? What years are important for leveling?*
~
- Appearance of incisors and eruption times of permanent incisors used
- Deciduous incisors smaller/narrower base than permanent incisors
- Stout to skinny legend as animal gets older
- Milk tooth (no permanent), 2 tooth, 4 tooth, 6 tooth, 8 tooth/full mouth
- 5 years: incisors in wear, occlusal table levelling 6-9 years from centrals to corners

# Sheep
~
- After 8 tooth/full mouth -> broken mouth 0> gummy mouth
