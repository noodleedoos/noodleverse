# Heat detection
*Describe the use of heat detection in natural mating vs supervised/AI mating for cattle, small ruminants, alpaca and deet*
~
Natural Mating: Males detect on-heat females via pheromones
Supervised Mating/AI:
- Physical signs - swollen vulva, behaviour changes 'winking' in horses
- For dairy cattle - Kamars heat pad - detects mounting
- Beef cattle - cows riding cow on heat
- Small ruminants - mating crayon
- For horses - Ultrasound of follicles
- Assess acceptance of male in a paddock
- Alpaca and deer - male in the paddock
