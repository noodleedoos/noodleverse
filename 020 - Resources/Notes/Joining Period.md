# Definition
~
Period of time males are in the paddock with females, is conducted expressed as number of cycles or number of weeks, commonly 2-3 cycles as dependent on [[Oestrus Cycle Length and Patterns]] or 2 cycles for [[Artificial Insemination]]

# Examples
e.g joining period of 2 cycles for beef cattle will be
~
6 weeks as each cycle is 21 days

e.g. joining period of 3 cycles for sheep will be 
~
7-8 weeks as each cycle is 17 days

# Heat detection
*Describe the use of heat detection in natural mating vs supervised/AI mating for cattle, small ruminants, alpaca and deet*
~
Natural Mating: Males detect on-heat females via pheromones
Supervised Mating/AI:
- Physical signs - swollen vulva, behaviour changes 'winking' in horses
- For dairy cattle - Kamars heat pad - detects mounting
- Beef cattle - cows riding cow on heat
- Small ruminants - mating crayon
- For horses - Ultrasound of follicles
- Assess acceptance of male in a paddock
- Alpaca and deer - male in the paddock
