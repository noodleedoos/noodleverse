# Definition
~
How many animals you can have on your farm

# French Model Stocking Rate Formula
~
- SR = 1.3(R-250)/25
- 1.3 times the yearly rainfall in mm minus 250, divided by 25
- e.g. A farm in western Victoria with rainfall of 650mm can support:
1.3 x (650 - 250) / 25 = 20.8 [[DSE]]/ha

1. Determine size of farm
2. Determine Stocking rate
3. Determine how many specific animals it can manage

*How many cows(#) can a 10 000 DSE Farm carry with different calving times?*
~
Breeding femalesDSE*# + 0.9#*weanerDSE + 0.03#*bullDSE = Total DSE
(if we have 100% cows, we are hoping for 90% weaners, AKA 45% female, 45% male)
Typo here: should be 10000 not 1000
