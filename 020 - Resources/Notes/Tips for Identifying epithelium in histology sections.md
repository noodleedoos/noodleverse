• The outlines of individual epithelial cells are not always visible, and it may be difficult to identify the shape of the cells.
• It is often helpful to look at the shape, location and spacing of the nuclei in the epithelium.
• How many cell layers seem to be visible in a section depends very much on the angle between the plane of the section and the plane of the surface of the
epithelium.
• Oblique sections of epithelium will be visible in almost all slides of organs in which epithelium lines a surface with a very irregular profile. A single
surface is usually not lined by several types of epithelia.
• The number of epithelial cell layers will usually be the smallest number of layers visible anywhere along the surface lined by the epithelium.
