### Activity 1A

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Estimated Time** | **10 Minutes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Objective**      | To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to analyse existing client information prior to commencement of counselling session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                    | List three ways of analysing existing client information.<br><br>1.     Consult other health professionals<br><br>Obtain medical records that may be relevant to the client’s counselling such as any conditions that affect the overall health of the client. It is important to know the medical history of a client as there may be predisposing conditions that affect the mental health of a client. Diagnosed mental disabilities and illnesses should be considered prior to commencing a counselling session to ensure a helpful experience.<br><br>2.     Examine the client’s Self-Assessment<br><br>Completed prior to the initial appointment with a counsellor, a client may complete a self-assessment form that identifies current health issues, state of wellbeing and goals for therapy. A counsellor should be aware of the client’s name, age and occupation prior to the first session to ensure the client feels comfortable and seen.<br><br>3.     Speak to relevant third parties if consent is provided<br><br>Collect personal information about the client if they are being represented by a family member, governmental agency or other healthcare facility. This can provide insight from the perspective of a witnessing party if the client is not in a state to contact the service independently. Establishing a collaborative effort with the dependent’s third party will aid in the effectiveness of counselling by providing tools and resources for support outside of a session. |

### Activity 1B

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to use initial session to gather additional client information as a foundation for counselling process.|
||Explain the difference between open and closed questions.<br><br>Open questions are used to obtain information other than ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They can be used to prompt a client to speak more and allow you to gather more information about the client. Examples of open ended questions are ‘How would you describe your relationship with your mother?’, or ‘Could you please tell me more about your education?’<br><br>Closed questions are used to obtain specific information pertaining to a specific prompt often resulting in one word answers such as ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Questions like these are useful for clients who struggle to speak in a coherent manner, organise their thoughts, require more prompting, or if you require specific information about a topic. Examples of closed questions are ‘have you had any suicidal thoughts in the past 2 weeks’, or ‘How many times a week do you exercise’. These can be a starting point to open further inquiries, for example, ‘What kind of exercise do you like to do?’.<br><br>Closed and open questions are important to gather additional client information as a foundation for the counselling process – a successful initial session involves the client doing most of the talking and you prompting them to speak more. It is important to gather as much information as a client as possible to ensure the services you provide are helpful for their personal development and unique to their circumstances and life experiences. Starting with a firm foundation of client information allows the client to feel more comfortable divulging more personal information to you – starting with a firm foundation enables a deeper analysis of more important problems. This will lead to reaching goals and achieving why the client has accessed your services.|

### Activity 1C

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to select and use communication techniques that support the initial counselling session objectives.|
||List five communication techniques that should be used in counselling.<br><br>1.     Body Language<br><br>Affirming the client’s speech by nodding, leaning forward and via eye contact will encourage the client to speak more about their experiences and thus allow the counsellor to gather more information about their situation.<br><br>2.     Active Listening<br><br>Active listening involves the conscious decision to listen to the client without thinking about what your response will be. You should eliminate any external distractors, maintain an open body language by not crossing your arms and legs and make sure to ask questions to clarify your understanding of the situation<br><br>3.     Paraphrasing<br><br>After performing active listening, you should rephrase what the client has explicated to you to confirm your understanding of the situation aligns with how the client feels. Paraphrasing allows an opportunity for the client to correct your understanding, but should not be overused to the point where the client feel alike you are filling in too many gaps and over-assuming knowledge<br><br>4.     Reframing<br><br>This is an important technique that should be used to allow the client to see the situation presented from another perspective to alter how they feel. For example, if a client presents a situation regarding feeling guilty for not having completed all their work on time, you could propose reasons for why this situation has occurred by asking prompting questions. For example, you could ask them about how heavy the workload was, whether there were any external stressors at the time or what support looked like for them during this time.<br><br>5.     Tone<br><br>Regulating your tone is essential in ensuring the client feels comfortable speaking to you and can encourage and discourage further discourse about a topic. You should regulate your tone of speech by volume, pitch, and ensure the language you use is comprehendible by the client. This may look like picking up on their vernacular and using certain words or mirroring their tone.|

### Activity 1D

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**15 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to follow a structured approach to counselling based on client needs and expectations.|
||1.     List three goals early counselling sessions should be dedicated to.<br><br>ONE: Building rapport<br><br>Build rapport by engaging in small talk, ensuring the client feels comfortable to share their issues with you.<br><br>You could begin the session by saying, “’Hi, nice to meet you, have a seat here, how’d you find getting to us today, was traffic okay?”, and offering them a drink of water, adjusting the air conditioning to suit them.<br><br>TWO: Defining goals of counselling<br><br>After the client has settled in, you could ask them, “So, what has brought you in today?” it is important that you are listening to their concerns and you can empathise with their experience. Try to listen more than talk before providing your own professional opinion<br><br>THREE: Explaining future sessions and logistics of counselling<br><br>Make sure the client is aware of how future sessions will work and the parameters of the service you provide.<br><br>2.     List three goals which the main body of the sessions should be dedicated to.<br><br>ONE: Investigating recurring themes in more detail<br><br>You should ask open ended questions to incite the client to share more information, so you are able to grasp their experience holistically.<br><br>TWO: Building on themes from previous sessions<br><br>You should follow up with previous concerns, and anything that has come up between last session and the current session and address them accordingly<br><br>THREE: Set homework<br><br>Send the client away with something they are able to implement into their daily lives so progress can be made outside of the session.<br><br>3.     List three goals which later counselling sessions should be dedicated to.<br><br>ONE: Providing information and resources<br><br>Send client away with information and resources they can refer to without you.<br><br>TWO: Recapping what has happened so far<br><br>Restate what has happened in the sessions, what you have accomplished and reflect on the experiences and how they’re feelings have changed.<br><br>THREE: Refer clients if necessary<br><br>If further treatment is required, refer clients to specialists.|

### Activity 2A

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to provide information that assists clients to understand the nature of the counselling service on offer.|
||List five ways of explaining the nature of your counselling service.<br><br>1.     Explain the principles of person centred therapy<br><br>These include ‘The Humanist approach’, ‘self realisation’, ‘conditions of worth’, ‘fully functioning person’ and a phenomenological approach<br><br>The humanist approach seeks to identify a person in good light – takes the person for the truth at face value. Person centred therapy aims for self realisation, in which the person is aims for goals they have set to have a fulfilling life. Conditions of worth refer to the imposition of valued opinions that are detrimental to the person themselves. A phenomenon perspective identifies that each person has their own experience which is true to themselves. A fully functioning person is in excellent emotional health – i.e. able to trust themselves and others, lives with purpose and for experience.<br><br>2.     Explain the reasons some may attend counselling<br><br>You should explain what your specialisation is and perhaps delve into other reasons people attend counselling services, such as domestic violence, addiction, obstacles that interfere with day-to-day life or simply requiring someone outside their immediate circle to talk to<br><br>3.     Explain the purpose of counselling<br><br>The purpose of counselling is linked to person-centred therapy, in which we aim for a fully-functioning person via a phenomenal perspective and humanistic approach.<br><br>4.     Explain what counselling is not for<br><br>Make sure the client is aware that counselling is not the end all and be all- it cannot solve all the clients problems. Make sure the client is aware of the limitations of counselling and that counselling is not a friendly conversation or to gain advice.<br><br>5.     Explain that counselling requires a commitment<br><br>For progress to be made, clients must consistently attend counselling sessions, whether that be once a fortnight or once a week.|

### Activity 2B

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**15 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to clarify, confirm or modify client expectations of the counselling service.|
||1.     Why is it important to clarify the client’s expectations of the counselling service?<br><br>It is important to clarify the client’s expectations of the counselling experience so they know exactly what they are in for and what they can derive from the services provided. This is done so they do not expect something that is a service you cannot provide or is not the reason for the service such as prescribing medicine, diagnosis or giving advice. Clarifying the client’s expectations of the counselling service limits the disappointment or confusion regarding the contents of the service.<br><br>2.     How can you clarify the client’s expectations of the counselling service?<br><br>At the start of the initial session, you could detail your credentials, what the service you provide is, the limitations of your service, the clients rights and how you aim to uphold them. You should tell them what you specialise in, what you have experience in and where you will have to refer them to if it is outside your scope of practice. Ensure the client is aware of their rights with regards to receiving equitable, non-discriminatory and quality service.|

### Activity 2C

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to know about identifying client anxieties about the counselling process and exploring with clients.|
||List five anxieties a client may have about the counselling process.<br><br>1.     Unsupportive support network and embarrassment<br><br>Client’s may feel like or may be subject to ridicule due to the myths surrounding counselling and be resistant to seeking help. Family and friends who are unfamiliar with counselling may deem it only for the weak or mentally ill.<br><br>2.     Confidentiality worries<br><br>It is a myth that information shared in sessions is discussed between colleagues and the counsellor should reaffirm the privacy rights of the client if this is a worry they hold.<br><br>3.     Bad previous experience<br><br>Clients who have had negative experiences with counsellors or therapy in the past may have a warped perception as to the benefits of therapy<br><br>4.     Stigma surrounding therapy<br><br>The client may hold a certain belief about therapy, who receives it and may hold incorrect opinions about the counselling service you provide based on societal input<br><br>5.     A preference for self reliance<br><br>Clients may be prideful and dislike the feeling of dependence on an external support such as a counsellor.|

### Activity 2D

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**15 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to acknowledge and show respect for client’s immediate concerns.|
||Explain why and how you should always acknowledge and respect the client’s concerns.<br><br>Why?<br><br>It is necessary to always acknowledge and respect the client’s concerns because it is in the best interest of the client to make them feel human, normal and understood. If you do not acknowledge or respect the client’s concerns, they may feel alienated and rejected, or unhappy that they have taken the step to seek help which is counterproductive to the end goal of a fully functional person.<br><br>How?<br><br>You should always put your own personal opinions, beliefs and values aside during a counselling session and be open to listen with curiosity. Understand that what they believe is true to them, and you should always respond with normalcy without shock or repulse to make them feel as normal as possible. Do not make them feel ill as this is not your place to do so. Remember that expression of feeling does not require a solution and when you ask questions, the questions do not contain hidden assumptions or suggested answers.|

### Activity 2E

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to clarify both expectations and commitment to the counselling relationship and confirm with clients.|
||According to Gerald Corey, what should the limits/expectations of a counselling relationship be based on?<br><br>Gerald Corey proposes there are certain limitations and expectations of a counselling relationship. Besides the obvious ones like do not befriend the client, or offer counsel to the people your client mentions, you should also be aware of the expectations and limitations of other ethical dilemmas. This can include Non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, justice and fidelity.<br><br>Non maleficence refers to not doing harm on purpose. This can look like making sure you know who you are referring a person to and they are accredited and registered. It can also look like making sure that you provide different treatment options and the benefits outweigh any negatives of treatment.<br><br>Beneficence refers to wanting to do good, and it is the responsibilities upheld by the counsellor in that they are responsible for the welfare of the client by therapy.<br><br>Autonomy refers to respecting the independency of a client and they are in charge of the decisions for themselves. You should not force treatment on a person, for example.<br><br>Justice refers to your responsibility to treat everyone the same in an equal manner.<br><br>Fidelity refers to your responsibility to be honest and upfront with the client.|

### Activity 3A

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**15 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to explore options and approaches for the relationship with clients according to individual need.|
||1.     According to individual need, which aspects of the counselling relationship might you need to adapt?<br><br>-        Tone<br><br>Some clients are quieter than others and it may improve the counselling relationship if you speak in a softer tone. Other clients will aim to provoke a reaction after telling a sequence of events. Be sure to affirm whatever the client is saying so they do not feel out of place.<br><br>-        Question type and amount<br><br>Some clients will be able to talk about their own experience and need less prompting, while others may be unsure of how they feel or how to articulate their experience. In this case you could ask more closed questions to simplify the process, such as, “did that make you feel more sad or happy?” instead of “how did that make you feel?”<br><br>-        How much you have to interrupt<br><br>If the client does not allow you to have input at a critical point, you may have to interrupt more frequently. The purpose of counselling is to guide a person to independence and becoming a fully functional human, and if this means you need to tell them something but they aren’t giving you an opportunity, you will need to interrupt.<br><br>-        How often you have to change the subject back to a relevant theme<br><br>Some clients may not be able to gauge when information they are speaking of is irrelevant to the topic, or go off topic intentionally to avoid confronting an issue, while others will stay on topic and require less guidance back to the main theme.<br><br>_2._     _List four ways you should be mindful of the client’s personal identity._<br><br>_-_        _Be aware of their sexuality and gender identity_<br><br>_It is important to be aware of the client’s orientations to affirm their identity_<br><br>_-_        _Be aware of their cultural context_<br><br>_Some cultures are more evasive to eye contact such as some Islamic cultures. Adjust your language to cater to how they speak, making societal inferences if you are able to._<br><br>_-_        _Be aware in terms of their personality_<br><br>_Everyone has a different way of communicating – some like to make eye contact and use hand gestures, others do not. Reciprocate their energy to ensure they feel normalised._<br><br>_-_        _Do not impose your own values_<br><br>_Keep the counselling session away from your own personal beliefs as this is not about you._|

### Activity 3B

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to agree priorities and develop a plan for counselling in collaboration with the client.|
||Goals should always be S.M.A.R.T. What does ‘S.M.A.R.T.’ stand for?<br><br>Specific<br><br>Make sure your goal is specific – instead of a goal like ‘Eat healthier’, it could be ‘eat fruit once a day’.<br><br>Measurable<br><br>Have discrete values, or use a rating system to keep track of progress.<br><br>Actionable<br><br>Have steps the client can take to make this goal come true. For example, if they are having trouble eating fruit, you could come up with a way to methodically make it easier to do, such as<br><br>1.     Go to the supermarket<br><br>2.     Get 7 apples<br><br>3.     Each day, put an apple in your bag before you leave the house<br><br>4.     At 12:00pm, eat the apple<br><br>5.     Report back in 7 days<br><br>Realistic<br><br>Don’t set goals that are unrealistic for the client, in this case it would be ‘eat a variety of organic fruits and vegetables 7 times a day’<br><br>Timeframe<br><br>Having a deadline helps motivate clients towards reaching a goal. This could be until next week or the end of your counselling service.|

### Activity 3C

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**10 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|To provide you with an opportunity to identify how to make documented agreement with the client that addresses disclosure and organisation requirements.|
||List seven key concepts related to care provision that you should understand.<br><br>1.     Discrimination<br><br>Take care to be considerate of treating every fairly and equally, regardless of sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, social status, disability and other personal details<br><br>2.     Work Health and Safety<br><br>Make sure you are aware of any emergency procedures and hygiene policies such as where the fire exit is, or what smoking on the premises is like<br><br>3.     Mandatory reporting<br><br>Be aware of when you have to report a person to the relevant authorities in spite of confidentiality agreement. This could be when the person threatens to harm themselves or someone else in a serious manner.<br><br>4.     [[Duty of care]]<br><br>Be aware of the needs of the client, those involved and yourself when acting.<br><br>5.     Privacy, confidentiality and disclosure<br><br>Make sure you understand the laws around privacy, confidentiality and disclosure and make sure this is included in a documented agreement<br><br>6.     Contract requirements<br><br>Make sure when you are writing up a contract you know what to include, or if the contract is already written up, you know what is inside it and have read it thoroughly<br><br>7.     Ethical considerations<br><br>Make sure your practice is ethical and agrees with the law. Make sure your clients know complaint procedures|
