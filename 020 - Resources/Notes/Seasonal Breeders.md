# Seasonal Breeders
~
[[Temperate deer]], [[goats]] and [[Long wool british breed sheep]]
Young born at favourable time of year for higher survival rate

## Considerations
~
dairy goats will need hormones to get goats cycling out of season e.g. [[Regulin]]

## Seasonally Polyoestrous
~
cycle continously during reproductive season until pregnant
