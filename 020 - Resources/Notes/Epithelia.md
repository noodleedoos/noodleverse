# Forms of Epithelium
~
• [[Surface epithelium]] – sheets of cells that cover external surfaces and line internal surfaces of the body
• [[Glandular epithelium]] – secretory cells of glands

# Classification based on 
~
## Cell layers
1. Simple epithelia – a single cell layer thick
2. Stratified epithelia – two or more layers of cells
3. Pseudostratified epithelia – appear to be stratified, because the cells vary in
height and the nuclei lie at different levels
## Shape
1. Squamous cells – flat cells
2. Cuboidal cells – Height and width of the cells are the same
3. Columnar cells – cells are taller than they are wide

# Types
~
[[Simple squamous epithelium]]
[[Simple cuboidal epithelium]]
[[Simple columnar epithelium]]
[[Stratified Squamous Epithelium]]
[[Transitional epithelium]]
[[Pseudostratified columnar epithelium]]


# Surface characteristics
Epithelial cells have three distinct surfaces
~
7. Basal surface – rests on the [[Basement membrane]]
8. Lateral (or contact) surface – in contact with neighbouring epithelial cells
9. Apical (or free) surface
