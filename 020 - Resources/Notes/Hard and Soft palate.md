# Function of palates
~
- Separates oral cavity from nasal cavity
- Comprised of hard palate rostrally and soft palate caudally
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,268-->

# Structure of Hard Palate
~
- Bone covered by thick mucosa which forms ridges (rugae) pointing backwards to help guide food caudally
<!--SR:!2025-03-12,2,248-->

## Layers:
*What is the difference in ruminants? Are there any salivary glands in any animals?*
~
- Mucosal epithelium keratinised
- Submucosa dense and closely attached to periosteum (outer fibrous covering of bone)
- Ruminants have a dental pad
	- rostral portion of hard palate
- heavy keratinised mucosa overlying a thick layer of dense connective tissue
- Palatine glands (minor salivary) are present in all domestic species except pigs
<!--SR:!2025-03-11,1,228-->

## Bone associated:
~
- Incisive, maxilla and palatine bones
<!--SR:!2025-03-12,2,248-->

# Soft palate
What are the layers of the soft palate? Do they have any salivary glands?
~
- Comprises a dorsal and ventral mucosal layer separated by connective tissue
- minor salivary glands (palatine)
- 3 paired muscles which shorten, tense and raise the palate
