# Types
*Describe the 6 types of papillae, their structures, functions and any species variations*
~
Mechanical
1. [[Filiform papillae]] - [[Cavopapillae]] in cats
2. [[Conical Papillae]]roots of tongue on dogs, cats, pigs, ruminant cheek/lips/torus linguae
Gustatory
~
3. [[Fungiform Papillae]]
4. [[Foliate Papillae]] - Not in ruminants, no taste buds in cats (cows don't read and cats dont taste book!)
5. [[Vallate or Circumvallate Papillae]]
6. [[Marginal Papillae]]  - only in rostral tongue of newborn dog/pig, disappear when eat solids
