# Mechanisation
*Describe how mechanisation has changed throughout history*
~
- from horsedrawn equipment to modern tractors 
- Result: less people required, more efficient, better sowing

# Herbicides and Pesticides
*Describe how the use of herbicides changes the production system*
~
- Round up allows minimum till production systems because there is less tractor work required -> less soil compaction

# Fertiliser Use
*In Australia, what is the role of fertiliser?*
~
- Increases phosphorus, nitrogen
- Trace minerals cobalt and seleneium
- Lime for acid soil areas

# Cultivars
*Give an example of a cultivar used in production systems*
~
[[Subclover]]

# New Genotype
*Give examples of a new genotype used in production systems and why they are usefule*
~
[[Bos indicus cattle]]
[[Angora Goats]]
[[Boer Goats]]
[[Merino Sheep]]
Useful: improve production, reduce disease, improve welfare

# Water Reticulation
*Describe water reticulation in Australia and why it is necessary in Agricultural context*
~
Polypipe (stock water)
Irrigation from dams i.e. [[Murray Darling Basin]]
![[Pasted image 20241214115600.png]]
Use: so animals can wander, evenly distributed grazing

*Provide an example of a historical innovation related to grazing*
~
# [[Rotational Grazing]]
- Method: plant growth phase eaten then rested for regrowth
- goal: maximise plant growth
