## Aim 
- Determine the effect of observation on learning.
## Study Design
- 3-6 year old boys and girls
- Children watch adults perform aggressive acts and remarks towards a bobo doll and measure how they learn this behaviour
1. Match children based on aggressiveness rating ([[Matched Pairs Design]])

## Conclusion
- Exposure to aggressive modelling increased attraction to guns and novel hostile language
- Models serve as cues that alter learner's existing restraints to demonstrate new patterns of behaviour
