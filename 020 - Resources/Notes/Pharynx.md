# Structure
- The caudal boundary of the oral cavity is demarcated by the palatoglossal arches that extend from the soft palate to the body of the tongue
- Common to the respiratory and digestive system
- Has three parts:
	- [[Oropharynx]]
	- [[Nasopharynx]]
	- [[Laryngopharynx]]
- The [[Epiglottis]]

# Function

| Function | Passage                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Air      | From naasopharynx to larynx to trachea                  |
| Food     | From [[oropharynx]] to [[laryngopharynx]] to oesophagus |

| Dilator     | Transversely oriented fibres in the rostral pharynx                                                                                                                                | Acts to widen the rostral pharynx to allow it to accept the food bolus     |
| Shorteners  | These are longitudinal (rostro-caudal) oriented muscles                                                                                                                            | Act to shorten the pharynx and thus draw it forward over the bolus of food |
| Constrictor | The rostral, middle and caudal constrictors = major constrictors<br><br>- These originate from either side of the pharynx and meet in the dorsal midline to form arches of muscle. | They contract in succession to move food towards the oesophagus            |
