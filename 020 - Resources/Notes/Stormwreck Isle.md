## Act 1 - Dragon Rest
Ship crashed in big storm, we weake up on beach at Dragon Rest where we kill zombies. After this, we go the ruins of the chapel in Dragon's Rest where kobolds have made it their village. The party moves into the local bar where Sam stole all Sir Eggbert the Rotund's coins and convinced him it was a kobold. Sam stole from the cash register and bought everyone a drink. 

The party levelled up.

Grimbly son of Grom gathered local townspeople and tried to convert them to his cult by handing out torches he said would turn to bread overnight when put under a pillow. He gave a torch to a little girl whose family was starving.

In the middle of the night, Sam followed a child into the forest, and Sir Eggbert followed Sam. Upon failing a stealth check, Sir Eggbert revealed his location to Sam where they continued to follow the child to a ruined cloister. They left after determining it was nothiing of importance.

In the morning, the party ventured to the ruined cloister where Eggbert prayed to Bahamut while Sam and Grimbli fought some ghouls. Eggbert heard the battle and arrived to land the final kill on the last ghoul. Grimbli saw the corpse of an adventurer snd mistook it for a shade of death. A critical hit to the corpse caused it to explode into flesh goo puddle. Eggbert declared a goo fight and the party became covered in human remains. 

They returned to Dragons Rest where they were questioned by the kobolds as to their appearance. Grimbli claimed it was a religious practice and the little girl reappeared and questioned why her torch had not turned into bread. He explained that it was Sunday and the Lord was resting. 

All party members meet a Lady called Sarah who tell us get supplies from the Myconids in the underdark. They ventured into a nearby cave and found the village. Grimbli cast thormaturgy and snuffed out all the vilage candles, and opened and closed the windows. The meyor was unimpressed, and informed us that the myconids were unable to supply anything due to the fireworm, so the party sought out to kill it. 

First, they went to the local tavern and met the owners - The Enoki Brothers. While talking to the bartender, a new adventurer, Mr Beast the Gooner, walked in and he shat everywhere and pulled things out of his bum bum. After this, he gambled with gnomes. After winning first two rounds, he lost everything on the third and started a bar brawl. The rest of the party joined the fight and tried to do it unarmed, but Sam pulled out a sword and all the gnomes died. The Enoki Brothers kicked the party out after they covered it in shit. 

Outside, there was an angry mob because they had destroyed the tavern and its patrons. Mr. Beast the Gooner disarms the situation eloquently by mentioning the party is here to kill the fireworm. The mayor provided the party with a map and escorts the party to a hotel containing a bar and shop.

Upon arriving at the hotel, Grimbli seduced the shopkeeper and bartender seperately, convincing them to sleep with him upon killing the fireworm. At the same time, Mr Beast distracted the shopkeeper and stole a sword, leaving a note that he would return it. 

The party long rested.

In the morning, the party left the village to explore the tunnels. They discovered a fork in the path and headed right leading them into an Ankheg nest where they slaughtered the Ankheg.

The Ankheg nest was a pit of gore. To distract Mr Beast from their bulging money sack, Sam cast prestidigitation on the corpses, making them smell and taste like cherry pie. Mr Beast and Grimbli started consuming the corpses ravenously while Sam looted the bodies to find healing potions and Sir Eggbert vomited on the corspes, then proceeeded to cry in the corner. 

The party long rested. 

While long resting, Sir Eggbert dreamt that Sam left the cave. Upon waking, he saw Sam standing in the corner facing the wall. The party left the cave and continued to the next Myconid village following a map. They reached an opening where a giant underwater lake resided. At the banks of the lakes, Sam began twitching and turned into a changeling. The party killed the changeling, though Grimbli tried to throw the changeling unsuccessfully three times. Mr Beast dipped his arrows into the changeling's blood which turned them invisible, and Grimbli threw the body into the lake where it skipped like a stone.

The party noticed another path leading to another cave before crossing the lake. They parted the vines to the entrance of the cave to uncover Sam covereed in pulsating plant growths. The party cut Sam free, and Eggbert carried the coma induced log with them. 

The party returned to the dock at the lake, where Eggbert placed Sam into the boat and fell into the water. Mr Beast grabbed him as he was falling and pulled him back up, then they crossed the river. Eggbert tried to put Sam onto the dock but fell into the lake. Mr Beast had to strip off his armor to drag Eggbert to the surface. Mr Beast offered to clean Eggbert's armor which was a thinly veiled attempt to steal the armor. Eggbert persuaded Mr Beast to give **him** his armor instead, leaving Mr. Beast armorless.

They continued onto the next Myconid village, where Grimbli recasts thormaturgy at the front of the gate while the other party members hide. He enters the village and talks to the mayor of the decrepit village. Mr Beast enters, and they tell the mayor they will kill the fireworm and have a comatose party member. They leave Sam with the Myconid healer, and Eggbert sneaks into the rest site.

The party long rested.

The party leaves with the Myconid mayor in the morning to kill the fireworm. The outskirts of the village house a magical shining wall which is meant to keep the fireworm out. They party hunts the fireworm beyond the wall. They come to a big cave opening where they can see a big red pulsating egg at the other end. 

Mr Beast shoots a bolt at the egg and a baby fireworm erupted from the egg which the party slaughtered. The mother appeared and was slaughtered too. Mr Beast and Eggbert barely surrvived because every time they hit it, they were burnt by the aura of fire surround it

They returned to the village where all the Myconids were cheering in the village centre. Each adventurer was offered a choice of a purple or blue mushroom. Mr Beast and Eggbert got purple mushrooms and Grimbli got a blue one. Despite not knowing the properties of the mushroom as soon as Eggbert got his purple mushroom, he turned to Mr Beast and forced him to eat it. The purple mushroom was a mind crontrol mushroom and Eggbert had control over Mr Beast. Later it was discovered that the blue mshroom let the consumer breathe underrwater.

The party left the village after picking up comatose Sam and upon traversing the lake, they met a plesiosaur. The plesiosaur was killed, though the party was left barely alive. Some merfolk emerged and thanked the party for killing their long term predator, rewarding them with a horn that could be blown signalling the merfolk to come and provide assitance in a time of need.

The party levelled up. 

They retraced their steps to the first Myconid village where the mayor awaited their return. He had been informed by the other village of the fireworm's slaughter and the party was rewarded and went to the tavern to celebrate. They received a free round of drinks. Grimbli spoke to the bartender while Sir Eggbert sat with an unconscious Sam, and Mr Beast on the stage sang 'Big Girls, you are beautiful'. For his encore, he sang 'Father and Son'.

The party returned to the hotel to rest. Mr Beast returned the sword, Grimbli spoke to the bartender and they went up to his room together. Mr Beast and Eggbert went to sleep. Grimbli lathered the bartender in kobold oil and cast sacred flame. After devouring some, he disposed of the body in a dumpster before returning to his quarters.

In the morning, the party returned to meet Sarah in Dragon's Rest in her office. They kicked open the doors, smashiing them off the hinges, and repeated 'Worm's dead.' until she praised them for being special. The supplies from the Myconids were able to feed the kobold village for a long time, so the party celebrated in the tavern.

At the tavern, the party met the little girl whose torch still had not turned into bread. She was sick of Grimbli's lies and stabbed him with a poison knife who was immediately incapacitated. Eggbert and Mr Beast retrieved healing potions from Sam's backpack, but when they opened them it was revealed one was a mimic. The mimic was killed and gave the remaining potion to Grimbli. The townspeople exiled the child for stabbing him.

The party long rested.

In the morning, the party met Sarah who scheduled a meeting at a location. The party travelled through the forset where they were attacked by an owlbear which they killed and continued on to meet Sarah. Sarah revealed that she was a good dragon, but there was a powerful bad dragon on Stormwreck Isle which she defeated and kept under the island. The door is locked, and the key is split into three parts which were stolen from her. One is in the merfolk village with a notorious crime boss, one in the dark forest with the warboss orc, and one with the duegar in the Serrated Mountains with the emporer. 

The party returned to Dragon's Rest and checked the noticeboard for quests before continuing the main adventured and found 3 quests:
1. Sort out Evil Spirits in a Haunted Hous
2. Figure out why villagers from a village were disappearing
3. Help local circus find Missing Owelbear

Quest 1: Local village leader informed the party members that all the crops were dying because of the evil presence. They ventrued into a house where they discovered the family had been tortured by orcs and burnt alive. Eggbert cast detect Evil or Good, and found 3 bad upstairs and one downstairs. 

The party went upstairs and went into the first room - a small child's bedroom. Eggbert jumped on the bed and said it was far too soft. Grimbli opened the cupboards to be greeted by a screaming ghost child which disappeared to the basement. 

Grimbli tried to kick open the door of the next room but failed, and Eggbert kicked it open. From under the bed, which was far too hard, emerged a hand which pulled Eggbert under it. He screamed, and the ghost vanished to the basement.

Eggbert was too scared to enter the last door, so Grimbli greeted the spirit which too went to the basement. 

The party went to the basement, where they were met with a wraith and 3 ghosts. Eggbert was immediately knocked out, Sam and Grimbli struggled to do any damage, but a divine power intervened and they managed to oneshot the remaining ghosts.

The party left the building and informed the village man of the completion of the quest. They were rewarded with some gold and a special item for Grimbli.

The party long rested at Dragon's Rest.
