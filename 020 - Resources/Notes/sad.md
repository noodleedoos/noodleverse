i am sad because there is too much going on

**ChatCBT:**  I understand that you feel overwhelmed. Let's work together to identify the cause of this feeling and change your perspective to cope better. Can you tell me about the specific situations causing you stress? (Identify troubling situations)

Once we have a clear picture, we can start examining the thoughts connected with these situations. What are some negative thoughts or beliefs that come to mind when thinking about these issues? (Identify thoughts and emotions)

I suspect you might be experiencing several types of cognitive distortions. For example, you may be overestimating the importance of the problems or engaging in all-or-nothing thinking (polarized thinking). Can you identify any thoughts that fit this category?

Let's explore these thoughts further. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is too much going on, and what evidence contradicts it? (Evidence questioning)
