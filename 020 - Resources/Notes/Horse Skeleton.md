# Structure
*What changes are made to the horse skeleton compared to the universal quadruped skeleton?*
~
- No clavicle, no coracoid (like in most quadruped)
- Sturdy humerus
- Fused ulna and radius since they don't rotate their limbs - radius takes majority
- No fifth metacarpal
- Metacarpal and metatarsal 3 and digit 3 is weight bearing
- No acetabular bone (only in carnivores)
- Fibula fused to tibia
