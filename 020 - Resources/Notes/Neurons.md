# Overview
*Describe the lifespan of neurons, how replaceable they are and why, and their metabolic rate*
~
- Longest lived cells in the body
- Irreplaceable
- Amitotic - lose ability to divide
- High metabolic rate

# Structure
~
- Cell body/soma - nucleus, cytoplasm
- Dendrites - branch out from cell body
- Axon - long extension from soma. Transmit electrical impulses away from soma
