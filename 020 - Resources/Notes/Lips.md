# Structure
## Layers:
*Compare the layers of lips in horses, ruminants, carnivores and pigs*
~
1. Oral Mucosa
	- Epithelium keratinised in horses and ruminants, not in carnivores or pigs
2. Submucosa
	1. Contains minor salivary glands (labial glands) with duct opening through oral mucosa
3. Muscle, tendon
- Skin is external
Mucocutaneous Junction:
- The junction between the skin and the oral mucosa

## Lip margin
*Describe species variations in lip margin*
~

| Animal     | Variation                                                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dog        | Serrated margin, loose<br>![[Pasted image 20250309131006.png]]                          |
| Horse      | Sensitive and mobile<br>![[Pasted image 20250309131113.png]]                            |
| Ox         | Insensitive, thick, cone shaped buccal papillae<br>![[Pasted image 20250309131011.png]] |
| Herbivores | Small gape = sucking water                                                              |
| Carnivores | Large gape = lapping water                                                              |
### Philtrum
*Describe what a philtrum is, which species it is found in*
~
- Cleft marking division of upper lip
- Dog, cat, camelids, sheep (for closer grazing)

# Muscles
*Describe the superficial muscles in the head of an animal*
~

| Muscle                                  | Function                                                           | Innervation           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| [[Orbicularis oris]]                    | Close lips. The only major muscle - the rest has species variation | [[Cranial Nerve VII - Facial]] |
| [[Levator nasolabialis]]                | Dilate nostril, lift upper lip                                     | [[Cranial Nerve VII - Facial]] |
| [[Caninus]]                             | Lift upper lip, sometimes dilate nostrils (snarl in dogs)          | [[Cranial Nerve VII - Facial]] |
| Levator Labii superioris and inferioris | Lift upper/lower lip                                               | [[Cranial Nerve VII - Facial]] |
