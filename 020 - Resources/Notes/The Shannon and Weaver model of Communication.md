By Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver in 1940s

Further than [[Lasswell's Model of Communication]] = includes feedback and noise

1. Sender/originator delivers message
2. Encoder/transmitter = medium that sends message via signals/soundwaves/binary data
3. Channel = method of delivery
4. Decoder = where signal is converted back to information
5. Receiver = intended destination of sender. provides feedback in response
