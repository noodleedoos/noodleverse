*What are the 5 steps involved in negative feedback loops?* 
~
# Pathway
1. Stimulus produces change in variable
2. Receptor detect change (afferent pathway)
3. Input - information sent along afferent pathway to control centre
4. Output - information sent along efferent pathway to effector
5. Response - feeds back to reduce effect of stimulus

## Example - Thermoregulation
*Describe how thermoregulation is a negative feedback loop.*

## Example - Regulation of Thyroid Hormone
*Describe how regulation of the thyroid hormone is a negative feedback loop*
~
1. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) is released from hypothalamus
2. TRH causes TSH is produced by Anterior Pituitary gland, which downregulates TRH production
3. TSH causes thyroid to produce thyroxine, which downregulates the production of TSH and TRH
