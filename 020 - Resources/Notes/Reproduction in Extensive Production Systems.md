# Things we have control over
*What is the range of ages/weights when different extensive livestock species are mated and how is this chosen?*
~
[[Age at joining]]
Timing of parturition, time and length of mating
<!--SR:!2025-03-14,4,272-->

# Importance of reproduction
*How can we maintain* group size?
~
1. Maintain group size
2. Replace dead and those beyond effecting breeding age (Cast for age = CFA)
3. Allow genetic selection
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,257-->

# Percentage Requirements to maintain group and why
~
- 50-60% so females can replaced culled
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,254-->

# Impact on production
~
Must give birth to produce milk
<!--SR:!2025-03-14,4,276-->


# 2 Impacts of Reproduction on Management Procedures
~
- Reduced handling in last third of gestation and post parturition
- increase feed/attention in pregnant/lactating
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,257-->

# Impacts of Reproduction on Animal health
*What are 2 risks related to this, and how does ages in a self replacing group impact this?*
~
- STDs,
- disease risk during pregnancy/lactation
- Different ages in self replacing group means only a certain age group might be infected
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,254-->

# Key Events in a reproduction system
~
1. Joining
2. Gestation
3. Parturition
4. Lactation
5. Return to oestrus
<!--SR:!2025-03-14,4,279-->

# Events relating to reproduction for females
~
1. [[Age at joining]]
2. [[Oestrus Cycle Length and Patterns]]
3. [[Mating Methods]]
4. [[Joining Period]]
5. [[Pregnancy Testing]]
6. [[Gestation Period]]
7. [[Parturition]]
8. [[Lactation]] and [[Weaning]]
9. [[Return to Oestrus]]
<!--SR:!2025-03-14,4,274-->

# Events in Male Reproduction

# Reproductive Issues

[[Measuring Reproductive Rate]]
[[Sheep Survival Rate]]

# Stages at which reproductive loss can occur
~
1. Conception
2. Parturition
3. Pre-weanning
4. Post-weaning
5. Adult
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,252-->

# Estimate reproductive wastage
~
- FInd difference between progeny and number of females bred x industry standard for progeny per female
<!--SR:!2025-03-14,4,278-->

# Causes of reproductive loss
~
1. [[Genetics Defects reducing reproductive rate]]
2. [[Nutrition]]
3. [[Infectious Disease]]
4. [[Predation]]
5. [[Environment]]
6. Poor condition score
<!--SR:!2025-03-13,3,257-->

# Measures to improve success
*3 ways*
~
find and remove remove causes that reduce optimisation of success
optimise condition score given nutritional and seasonal constraints
match breeding with season, match lactation to maximum grass production
