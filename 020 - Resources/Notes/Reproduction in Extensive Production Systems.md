# Things we have control over
*What is the range of ages/weights when different extensive livestock species are mated and how is this chosen?*
~
[[Age at joining]]
Timing of parturition, time and length of mating

# Importance of reproduction
*How can we maintain* group size?
~
1. Maintain group size
2. Replace dead and those beyond effecting breeding age (Cast for age = CFA)
3. Allow genetic selection

# Percentage Requirements to maintain group and why
~
- 50-60% so females can replaced culled

# Impact on production 
~
Must give birth to produce milk


# Impacts of Reproduction on Management Procedures
~
- Reduced handling in last third of gestation and post parturition
- increase feed/attention in prenant/lactating

# Impacts of Reproduction on Animal health
~
- STDs, 
- disease risk during pregnancy/lactation
- Different ages in self replacing group means only a certain age group might be infected

# Key Events in a reproduction system
~
1. Joining
2. Gestation
3. Parturition
4. Lactation
5. Return to oestrus

# Events relating to reproduction for females
~
1. [[Age at joining]]
2. [[Oestrus Cycle Length and Patterns]]
3. [[Mating Methods]]
4. [[Joining Period]]
5. [[Pregnancy Testing]]
6. [[Gestation Period]]
7. [[Parturition]]
8. [[Lactation]] and [[Weaning]]
9. [[Return to Oestrus]]

# Events in Male Reproduction
~
1. [[Age at joining]]
2. [[Male Sexual Soundness Exam]]


# Reproductive Issues

[[Measuring Reproductive Rate]]
[[Sheep Survival Rate]]

# Stages at which reproductive loss can occur
~
1. Conception
2. Parturition
3. Pre-weanning
4. Post-weaning
5. Adult

# Estimate reproductive wastage
~
- FInd difference between progeny and number of females bred x industry standard for progeny per female
# Causes of reproductive loss
~
1. [[Genetics Defects reducing reproductive rate]]
2. [[Nutrition]]
3. [[Infectious Disease]]
4. [[Predation]]
5. [[Environment]]
6. Poor condition score

# Measures to improve success
~ 
remove causes that reduce optimisation of success
optimase condition score given nutritional and seasonal constraints
match breeding with season, match lactation to maximum grass production
find causes of loss
