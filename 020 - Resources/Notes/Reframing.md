Objective: Get client to view topic in a different way to make them feel differently

## Types of Reframing
### Shifting from past to future
- example: reframing from being told you cant drive to you can learn to drive

### Shifting from passive to active
- example: powerless from self harm -> take small steps like attending support group

### Shifting from others to self
- Example: if others aren't being supportive -> how can you support yourself?

### Example:
- Client feels ashamed of neglecting friendship
- Counselor: ask them to consider reasons for why this might have happened
	- Did client not feel supported by them?
	- Were they under a significant amount of stress?
