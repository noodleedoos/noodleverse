Activity 1A

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**20 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to identify communication barriers and use strategies to overcome these barriers in the client-counsellor relationship.**|
||**Identify three potential communication barriers and the strategies that you could use to overcome these.**<br><br>1.     Environmental<br><br>If the room is too hot or cold, or perhaps the electricity is too loud or there is too much noise, or perhaps not enough noise, the client may feel unsafe. Adjust this by asking if they are comfortable, show them where the AC remote is, play white noise in the foyer<br><br>2.     Individual perception<br><br>If a client perceives something to be true about themselves, they may be less likely to engage. For example, if a client is experiencing depression, they may perceive this in a stereotypical manner. Educate your client so you are on the same page of what depression looks like to them.<br><br>3.     Age issues<br><br>If the client perceives the counsellor to be a significantly different age, they may hold prejudices of life experience, such as a young person may not confide in an older counsellor for fear of judgement. Ensure you have a judgement free aura and remind them that their experience is their own and you are there to help them through it, even if you haven’t lived their life.|

| **Objective**      | **To provide you with an opportunity to understand the client-counsellor relationship through selection and use of micro skills.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                    | **How can micro-skills help you to work with the client in the counselling process?**<br><br>Microskills such as paraphrasing, reflecting, mirroring, confronting, and active listening help work with the client in the counselling process by encouraging the client to speak about their experience and guiding them a direction that helps unpack a problem.<br><br>Paraphrasing is when you listen to a client and repeat back in a summarised manner what they have said. This allows them to correct your understanding and clarify any points.<br><br>Reflecting is when you encourage a client to think about a similar situation and ask how they worked through it at that stage. These skills could be applied to the current situation.<br><br>Mirroring is when you say key phrases or words after listening to a client to prompt them to speak more on the topic. It can also refer to mimicking their body language to build rapport.<br><br>Confronting is executed in a counselling relationship where the relationship is stable enough to challenge the opinion of a client to further their progress.<br><br>Active listening includes postural changes such as leaning forward and nodding, and staying in the moment to make sure the client knows you are listening to what they are saying. |

### Activity 1C

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**20 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to integrate the principles of effective communication into work practices.**|
||**As a workplace activity (or simulated activity), provide evidence of the principles of communication in your own workplace communications. Perform a short interaction with a client (person representing a client) to discuss a brief situation or to arrange a session activity.**<br><br>**This activity needs to be observed by the trainer/assessor or third party.**<br><br>**T_his activity will be assessed as part of your Performance Assessment. You do not need to complete it here._**|

### Activity 1D

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**20 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to recognise non-verbal communication cues.**|
||**What can be observed from the client in order to help with your client communications?**<br><br>You can observe non verbal behaviour that can indicate the state of a client’s wellbeing, whether they agree with you, comfort, or the strength of the relationship you have with them.<br><br>Posture<br><br>-        Open posture: relaxed arms and legs<br><br>-        Indicate a comfortable client<br><br>-        Closed posture: hunched back, crossed arms and legs – may indicate discomfort<br><br>You can also look for fidgeting, habitual behaviours like biting nails, twirling hair, shaking leg to monitor levels of anxiety or stimulation, perhaps in reaction to a certain trigger.<br><br>Non verbal cues may also include eye contact – a client making eye contact may indicate a deeper level of connection than one that does not, or perhaps there may be issues surrounding eye contact or comfortability with connecting with a person in this manner.<br><br>By monitoring a person’s facial expression, you may be able to determine what emotions they are feeling – smiling and relaxed if contented, or scrunched if uncomfortable. Use visual cues to clarify and confirm any verbal cues.<br><br>Non verbal cues should be used in tandem with verbal cues to better understand what emotions the client is experiencing.|

  

### Activity 1E

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**20 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to consider the impacts of different communication techniques on the client-counsellor relationship in the context of individual clients.**|
||**How do individuals take in (and understand) information?**<br><br>There are 3 methods of taking in and understanding information.<br><br>1.     Visual<br><br>A person may read, view or witness knowledge and comprehend it.<br><br>This may be through books, readings, lecture slides, worksheets, images or non-verbal cues.<br><br>2.     Auditory<br><br>A person may hear or listen to knowledge for comprehension. For example via music, sound cues like alarms, podcasts or audiobooks<br><br>3.     Kinaesthetic<br><br>A person may understand knowledge by performing it or witnessing it via a tangible experience – For example learning to knit by physically having the needles threading the yarn, or learning how to spell by tracing the letters and feeling their curves and points.<br><br>**Provide an example of how you can use a specific communication technique to work to the strengths of the client.**<br><br>If a client is a visual learner, you may choose to play to their strengths by sending them home with readings and textbooks. Informational pamphlets may be provided, or they may be directed to a website or resource where they can read more about a certain issue or topic.<br><br>Offering an alternative communication method such as writing may be useful in the situation where a client is not able to express their thoughts in a congruent manner verbally, or you may choose to write down key information to send home with them.<br><br>You may also opt to turn on automated closed captioning if the session is conducted over the internet, or provide images that relate to what the client is going through. You could use images of a smiling person and a sad person, and a client may point to which they identify with more, for instance.|

  

### Activity 1F

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**30-60 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to integrate case note taking with minimum distraction.**|
||**As a workplace activity (or simulated activity), take client notes during a client session, ensuring that these are made discreetly and without disturbance to the client.**<br><br>**This activity needs to be observed by the trainer/assessor or third party.**<br><br>**T_his activity will be assessed as part of your Performance Assessment. You do not need to complete it here._**|

### Activity 2A

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**30 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to select communication skills according to the sequence of a counselling interview; and identify points at which specialised counselling interviewing skills are appropriate for inclusion.**|
||**Explain the sequence of a counselling interview and the communication skills that you would use.**<br><br>Sequence of a Counselling interview<br><br>1.     Build rapport<br><br>2.     Form client counsellor relationship<br><br>3.     Collect personal information<br><br>4.     Define aims of counselling<br><br>5.     Understand client’s concerns<br><br>6.     Set goals<br><br>7.     Evaluate common themes<br><br>Communication skills to use<br><br>1.     Don’t give advice<br><br>2.     Be engaged<br><br>3.     Provide space to work through problems<br><br>4.     Be comfortable with silence<br><br>5.     Allow feeling expression<br><br>6.     Work through situations and emotions<br><br>7.     Stay focussed<br><br>8.     Practice active listening<br><br>9.     Use observational skills<br><br>**At which points might you use specialised counselling interview skills?**<br><br>You should use your specialised counselling interview skills especially in the initial sessions of a client-counsellor relationship. This is because it is necessary to establish rapport and build a positive professional relationship for any progress to be made.<br><br>You should never give advice to a client, instead work with them through their problems and discuss coping strategies and plans of action. Be wary of the stages of change model and note where a client falls into. If a client is in the pre-contemplation stage, they are not willing or fully aware that change is required. In which case, you should work at the pace of the client and not rush into anything, as this may result in a relapse where the client returns to old patterns of behaviour.<br><br>Use specialised counselling skills throughout all sessions and ensure that topics discussed pertain to the issues that the client needs to addressed by guiding the client back to the topic by asking open ended or compound questions. Simple questioning is required in early stages of counselling to obtain personal information such as occupation or age.|

### Activity 2B

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**30-60 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to use specialised counselling communication techniques based on their impacts and potential to enhance client development and growth.**|
||**As a workplace activity (or simulated activity) perform the following task:**<br><br>**Within a counselling session, show your use of specialist counselling communication techniques to assist in the client’s progress.**<br><br>**This activity needs to be observed by the trainer/assessor or third party.**<br><br>**T_his activity will be assessed as part of your Performance Assessment. You do not need to complete it here._**|

### Activity 2C

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Estimated Time**|**15 Minutes**|
|**Objective**|**To provide you with an opportunity to recognise strong client emotional reactions.**|
||**List the strong emotions (both positive and negative) that a client may display during a counselling session.**<br><br>Clients may display a range of emotions within a therapy session ranging from positive to negative. These could include<br><br>Anxiety – this is observable by an increased rate of speech, fidgeting or trembling, nervous energy or a change in behaviour.<br><br>Hopelessness – when a client feels stuck or like they want to give up, a change in tonality may be noted in how they hold themselves and present themselves in the session. The content may seem to reach a dead end and it is important that the counsellor provides support and affirms that the client is able to change<br><br>Frustration – if a client feels like they aren’t progressing at the rate they want to, they may become angry at themselves. They may also be frustrated at others or situations in general.<br><br>Fear – a client may feel scared or apprehensive about a situation, experience or person. Typical features of feature include an increase in fight-or-flight responsivity, and it is important in this scenario to be empathetic and respect the autonomy of the client.<br><br>Stress – Clients may come to counselling for assistance with coping with stress, and may express current situations in which stress is present and become distressed in recounting an experience.<br><br>In all these scenarios it is important to never engage in physical contact with the client as this is unprofessional and could be a trigger for past trauma in some clients.<br><br>Instead, you could pour them a glass of water. Counsellors should be wary of presenting tissues to a client as it could be seen by some clients to be a sign that the counsellor is not comfortable around tears or a sign for them to get it together. It is important to give the client time to express themselves and to be comfortable with silence and periods of reflection where neither party is speaking.|

|                    | **Provide an example of a client interaction and evaluate your communications for their effectiveness to assist the client.**<br><br>Example of client interaction: Client expresses apprehensiveness towards you as a young counsellor<br><br>Methods of communication:<br><br>Expressing understanding – it is important in this scenario to reflect what they are saying and acknowledge their feelings. By expressing your understanding of the situation, the client may feel more inclined to perceive you as a trustworthy person to confide in.<br><br>Recognising own limits – by expressing your own limitations as a young counsellor, you demonstrate a level of introspection that allows the growth of yourself and the client to create a stronger client-counsellor relationship. Verbalising your own limits demonstrates a sense of honesty and therefore encourages the client to continue being honest as the sentiment is being reciprocated<br><br>Reassuring of methodology – After recognising your own limitations, reassure the client of your methodology as backed by science and working through experiences you yourself haven’t gone through may give the client a sense of peace and reassurance that working with you to become better is not as dire as they expect.<br><br>Curiosity – expressing curiosity as to the client’s situation not only enables you to gain clarity about their experience but also allows the client to divulge more information that could help with the therapy. Ensure you approach from a non-judgemental side and perceive their experiences as true to themselves<br><br>Open ended questions – Asking open ended questions encourages the client to speak more about their situation and encourage their own introspection and internal biases.<br><br>In these methods of communication, it is always important to consider the client and the situation at hand and use these methods in a way that is most effective for the context. |

|                    | **Briefly list your values and beliefs and determine how these could impact on your clients.**<br><br>My Values and Beliefs<br><br>I value kindness. This could impact my clients if they divulge a situation in which I perceive that they have not been kind. It is important in this scenario that I do not judge them from acting in a certain manner and instead guide them through the situation through reflection and counselling interview techniques.<br><br>I believe in rightness and wrongness. If a client shares a belief that I believe to be factually incorrect and are close minded about changing this belief, I may become frustrated. It is important not to impose my own beliefs on the client and respect their autonomy.<br><br>I value introspection. A client may present as proud and be unwilling to reflect on their own flaws in a situation. When this happens, I should not jump to conclusions and try to solve the problem immediately and instead guide them through their thoughts to let them come to a conclusion of their own.<br><br>I am Christian. While I try to respect people of different spiritual backgrounds, if my client were a satanist I may not have much information or understanding about their beliefs. Instead of judging them, I should approach from an aspect of curiosity and non-judgement to allow them to feel safe in sharing their spirituality without my imposition.<br><br>My own struggles with mental illness may lead to me projecting my personal experiences to their situation. For example, if a client presents as anxious, I may automatically conclude their experience of anxiety was similar to mine, when in reality it could be completely different. I should try to gather information about the situation, ask non-leading questions and encourage them to divulge their experiences. It is important in this scenario that I refrain from Self-Disclosure as this may be perceived as unprofessional or a breach in the client-counsellor relationship. It is important to approach from a empathetic but detached manner so as to not impose my own beliefs around certain situations. |
