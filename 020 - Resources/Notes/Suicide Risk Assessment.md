# Things to Consider
- Does the person have a strong rapport with current service team?
- Does the person have a crisis/contingency plan covered in a recovery plan that may be implemented in the event of an emergency/escalation?
- Does the person have family members/carers, etc. who are willing and capable of taking the responsibility of protecting the person from self-harm/suicide?
- Would the trauma of a hospitalisation present a greater risk than continuing community care?
