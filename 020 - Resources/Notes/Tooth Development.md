# Overview
*describe how teeth develop in general*
~
in sum:
- ectoderm -> dental lamina -> tooth buds -> enamel organ -> deciduous teeth and permanent molars (permanent teeth from seeparate enale organs),
	- mesenchymal cells outside enamel organ -> dental sac ->
		- internal enamel epithelial cells->[[ameloblasts]]
		- inner layer of dental sac->[[cementoblasts]]
		- uppermost layer of cells in dental papilla -> [[odontoblasts]]
	- dental papilla upper layer->odontoblasts
**In More Detail:**
1. **Ectoderm** in Stomodeum (oral cavity) **thickens to form dental lamina**
2. Bud stage: **dental lamina forms tooth buds**
3. Cap stage: **dental buds expand to form enamel organ** which encloses **dental papilla** (mesenchymal condensation - see [[neural crest-derived mesenchyme]]).
	1. **Deciduous teeth and permanent molars** develop from these enamel organs
	2. **Permanent teeth form from separate enamel organs** from buds on lingual aspect of dental lamina
4. Bell stage - invagination of dental papillla, enamel organ becomes more concave, **mesenchymal cells outside enamel organ form dental sac**
	1. Internal/external enamel epithelium - from ectodermal cells lining concave/convex aspect of enamel organ
	2. In between = stellate reticulum for enamel development
	3. inner layer [[ameloblasts]] which stay on tooth surface until they are worn away after eruption
	4. Cells retreat away from their secretions so they are not embedded in it
5. Root formation
	1. epithelial root sheath forms around papilla
	2. Uppermost layer of cells in dental papillar -> odontoblasts
	3. Cementoblasts form from inner layer of dental sac
6. Middle layer of dental sac -> fibroblasts form periodontal ligament, outer layer -> osteoblasts form alveolar bone
7. Root grows, teeth pushed to oral cavity for crown eruption.
8. Permanent tooth but migrates to socket of temporary tooth for enamel organ formation, which degrades the temporary tooth.
