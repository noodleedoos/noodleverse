# Tooth Surfaces
*What is the vestibular surface?*
~ 
Area between the lips, teeth and cheeks

*When can we use the word palatine?*
~
When referring to lingual teeth in the upper arcade

*When can we use interdental surface names like mesial and distal?*
~
Only in carnivore teeth, not in herbivorous buccal teeth
