# Method
*List the 8 steps in preparing a histological slide*
~
1. Fixation -, usually formaldehyde
2. Embedding -remove water, add paraffin wax
3. Cutting - 5 microns thick using microton
4. Straighten sectionos in waterbath
5. transfer sections to slide
6. Dry on warmer
7. Stain with [[haemotoxylin]] and [[Eosin Stain]]
8. Coverslip

# Examination Considerations
~
- 2D representation of 3D structure

## Artefacts
*What are some examples of artefacts in histological slides?*
~
- Post mortem change
- variation in staining
- folds in sections
- Air bubbles in mounting medium
- shrinkage of tissue

## Staining Characteristics of H&E

| Staining Characteristic | Description | Mechanism                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Eosinophillic]]       | Pink        | Eosin stains the cytoplasm                                 |
| [[Basophillic]]         | Blue        | Haemotoylin stains DNA in nucleus and RNA in cell activity |
|                         |             |                                                            |
