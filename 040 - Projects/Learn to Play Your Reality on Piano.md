## Plan
Learn 8 bars a day!
2024-06-16 new plan - i don't think i can learn 8 bars a day - maybe 4 bars each hand seperately + 1 bar together



## Quest Log
ctrl-shift-D to add a log! 
[[2024-06-16]] - today i made this project! I found a jazz version and played for an hour i think.
[[2024-06-17]] - today i made a lot of progress! i can play the first four bars with 2 hands and the first page sight read.
[[2024-06-19]] - i can't remember whether I practiced yesterday, but I think I did a little bit. the first page sounds pretty good and I have worked on the second page first four bars hands together, and can sight read the end a little. I need to find a new copy tomorrow because the one I'm working on is cut short.
