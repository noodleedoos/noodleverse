what is immediacy?

##### assistant
 Immediacy is a counselling technique that involves counsellors making statements or asking questions that show they are fully present and engaged in the counselling session. This can help to build rapport and create a more comfortable and open environment for clients to share their thoughts and feelings. Examples of immediacy include using the client's name, making eye contact, nodding, and making encouraging gestures. Immediacy can also involve counsellors sharing personal experiences or feelings that are relevant to the client's situation, as long as it is appropriate and does not violate any professional boundaries.
