provide a quote from my vault that backs this up

##### assistant
Based on your notes, here's a quote from Carl Rogers that supports the concept of Person Centered Therapy:

"What is needed is a certain type of relationship between therapist and client which creates a climate of trust, in which the client can safely venture into the unknown, explore new ideas, and take risks."

This quote highlights the importance of building a strong therapeutic relationship and creating an environment where clients feel safe and supported in their personal growth and development.
